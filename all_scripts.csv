1,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"I think we need to change this Donald Trump joke... because Donald Trump was eaten by a lion this morning, on the International Space Station."
2,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Anyone listening? Yeah, okay."
3,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Cerie, how about, instead of doing the scripts, why don't you just organize those videotapes?"
4,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Oh, okay."
5,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Okay, actually, could you go downstairs and get me a chai tea?"
6,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Okay, um... where are my shoes?"
7,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"No, no, just go. Just go barefoot. Just leave your shoes. Okay."
8,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,We got to change this Trump joke.
9,1,4,Jack the Writer,PA,"Josh to the set, please, for ""Sniper""..."
10,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,Mr. Jordan?
11,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"What's up, Ken?"
12,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"I got your car washed like you asked, and I got that ""Baby On Board"" sign you wanted, to help you get tail."
13,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"Thanks, Ken. You done good."
14,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"It's my pleasure and my job, sir. Anything you ever need, just ask."
15,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,But I want you to know something.
16,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,You and me... It's not gonna be a one-way street.
17,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,'Cause I don't believe in one-way streets... not between people and not while I'm driving.
18,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Oh, okay."
19,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"So here's some advice I wish I would have got, when I was your age."
20,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"Live every week like it's ""Shark Week."""
21,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"That's Stan there. Happy birthday, Stan."
22,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"All right, we're halfway done. Let's take a little break. You guys want to have a one-minute dance party?"
23,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,Yeah!
24,1,4,Jack the Writer,Lutz,Good idea.
25,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Crank it, Toofer."
26,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Yeah, shake it. Feel the music."
27,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, Mr. Donaghy."
28,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"No, please, uh, finish your dance."
29,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, we were just taking a little break, and we all love the music of Chamillionaire."
30,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"I see. If you don't mind, I'll just observe from... over here."
31,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,You will? Why?
32,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Are you familiar with Six Sigma?
33,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Oh, yeah. It's a special kind of G. I. Joe."
34,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"It's Frank, right?"
35,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Y-yes, sir."
36,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Yeah.
37,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Frank, Six Sigma is the elite G. E. Executive Training Course. To master just its basic concepts, one must brave a five-day conference at a Sheraton. Six Sigma says that a manager must understand, every aspect of the business he or she oversees."
38,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Which means...
39,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"I'll be in here every day, soaking it up."
40,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"So, please, return to work and act like I'm not here."
41,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Okay. Let's get into Toofer's commercial parody. We were trying to think of a funnier cereal name.
42,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"The favorite options so far include, Honey Bunches of Sadness, Oat Bung, and Swastikos."
43,1,4,Jack the Writer,Toofer,"Uh, Froot Lupus."
44,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,No.
45,1,4,Jack the Writer,Lutz,Dingleberries.
46,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,Fart Nuggets.
47,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Sorry. That's really great.
48,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Okay, let's just think for another minute. Um, Frosted Mini-Guns."
49,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,No.
50,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,Lucky Bastards.
51,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"If you don't mind, I think we all really laughed at Fart Nuggets, so could we just move on, please?"
52,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Every day, huh?"
53,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,You guys want coffee?
54,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Oh, yeah."
55,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"So, I was doing some research on comedy, and I came across the cartoon strip ""Dilbert."", It's quite good. And I was wondering if we could do that."
56,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Do what?
57,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"""Dilbert."""
58,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,You guys want coffee?
59,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Oh, yeah."
60,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"No, no, no, no, no. You can't say that. Jeb Bush is a friend of mine."
61,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,Who should I change it to?
62,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Sean Penn. No, Barbra Streisand."
63,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,He guns it. Girl falls into the water.
64,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,You guys want coffee?
65,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"So he circled back, looking for her. Remember, it's pitch-black out. The boat hits something... hard... and you hear kind of, ""eeeeughh."", And Brokaw says, ""Just go. Don't look back."", Now, I'm not a writer, but maybe there's a skit in that."
66,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,Hey.
67,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,What's up? Good morning.
68,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"So, is Donaghy gonna be in the room again today?"
69,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Ugh, probably, yeah."
70,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"Well, you have to say something to him. You guys are not getting any work done."
71,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Really? You don't think his idea of starting with the catchphrases, and working backwards is panning out?"
72,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Nuts to you, McGillicuddy."
73,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Who ordered the wieners?
74,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Beep, beep, ribby, ribby!"
75,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Actually, Frank wrote a draft of ""Beep, beep, ribby, ribby."""
76,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"Look, you have to say something to Jack soon, or your writers are gonna revolt."
77,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,What do you all not understand? He's our boss.
78,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Me trying to tell Jack what to do, would be like you trying to boss around... which one of your kids is it that you're afraid of?"
79,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,Kyle. Kyle. So strong.
80,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, come on. That was a jacket. That's it. I got to talk to her about her clothes. She can't dress like that."
81,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"Yes, she can. People like the way she dresses."
82,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, come on. It's distracting. It's inappropriate."
83,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"You're inappropriate, you jerk, with your big, stupid face!"
84,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Come on.
85,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"No, Liz. Listen, listen, listen. Look at me. Look how bald I am. Look at my life. Please, just give me this one thing."
86,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Pete, no! Come on! I'm talking to her."
87,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,Talk to yourself!
88,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"K, my boy! What's the frequency, Ken? I need you to grab me some lunch."
89,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,Absolutely. What can I get for you?
90,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,I want nachos.
91,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Yes, sir."
92,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,From Yankee Stadium.
93,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Yes, sir!"
94,1,4,Jack the Writer,PA,"Jenna to the set, please, for ""United Nations Bloopers."""
95,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, hey, Cerie. I kind of need to talk to you about something. Do you have a second?"
96,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,Sure.
97,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Okay. This is gonna sound really weird, but, um... you need to wear a bra."
98,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Oh, no, I... I don't, actually. They kind of just stay up on their own. See?"
99,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Yeah, okay. What I'm saying is, you need to wear a bra to work, if you want to be taken seriously in this business."
100,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Oh, but I don't actually want to work in television."
101,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Career-wise, I'm just gonna marry rich, and then design handbags."
102,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Here's the thing. The way that you dress, is making some people around the office uncomfortable."
103,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,Really? Who?
104,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,Not me.
105,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,I guess it's mostly me that has the problem with it.
106,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Oh, because you have, like, one of those body-image things?"
107,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"No, it's not that."
108,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Good, because I was gonna say, you still have a good body."
109,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Well, thank you, but this isn't about me."
110,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Like, how'd you dress before you were married?"
111,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"I'm not married, Cerie."
112,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Oh, for some reason I thought you had, like, three kids."
113,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Nope. Never married. No kids.
114,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"'Cause sometimes you have, like, food stains on your shirt and stuff. I just assumed that it was kids."
115,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,You know what? Forget I mentioned it. You look great.
116,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Is it my birthday?
117,1,4,Jack the Writer,Toofer,You have to get Donaghy out of the room.
118,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Boy, we, as a group, might not smell great."
119,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Come on, he's stifling us. I feel like I just can't be myself around him."
120,1,4,Jack the Writer,Lutz,"Yeah, Tracy's downstairs right now, rehearsing the best thing we've written all week."
121,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"Beep, beep, ribby, ribby."
122,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,All right.
123,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"All right, I'll take care of it."
124,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Thanks, Liz."
125,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Hey, Mr. Donaghy."
126,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Sorry I'm late. I was at a luncheon for Ann Coulter's 60th birthday.
127,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, yeah. Listen, it's been really great having you in the room, these last few days..."
128,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Oh, it's been great for me, too, being around all this creativity."
129,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"I'll tell you, in the beginning, I thought it was gonna be a bit of a chore, honestly, but now... oh, I have an idea for you. Uh, Monkey Senate. We open on the Capitol..."
130,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,You can't be in here anymore!
131,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,What's that?
132,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,It's not working.
133,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"You're driving everybody crazy, and, okay, you can just fire me now, and I will go back to teaching improv to senior citizens."
134,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Why would I want to fire you? This is fine. Six Sigma values direct and honest communication, between coworkers, so, uh... Thank you, Liz."
135,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, sure."
136,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,I'll just head upstairs now.
137,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Okay, well, thank you for being so understanding."
138,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Absolutely.
139,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Oh, no! I will not let you down, sir."
140,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Go get help, girl."
141,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Hey, Jonathan. I left a bunch of messages for Jack, but I haven't heard back. Do you know if he got them?"
142,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jonathan,Mr. Donaghy's been very busy.
143,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, well, I just... I really need him to approve this budget."
144,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jonathan,"Well, I'm sorry. He's out of the country till the end of the week."
145,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,You want to know another key to success?
146,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"I do, Mr. Jordan."
147,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,Dress every day like you gonna get murdered in those clothes.
148,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"You did real good the other day with those nachos, but I need you to do something of a different nature."
149,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"Okay, would you agree when I say, that a man's freedom only exists, when he's free to pursue his desires?"
150,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Yes, I suppose I would."
151,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"Which means when the law conflicts with our desires, then we must operate outside the law."
152,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,You following me?
153,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Otherwise, we would no longer be free."
154,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"Now, I got a mission for you."
155,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Hey, Liz. I took your advice. I'm wearing a bra."
156,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"That's great, Cerie."
157,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jonathan,"Liz, can I speak to you for a second?"
158,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Sure. What's going on?
159,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jonathan,"Mr. Donaghy is very upset, that you banned him from the writers' room. He wants you to apologize."
160,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Really?!
161,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jonathan,"But when you apologize, you have to act like it was your idea. He can't know that I told you."
162,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,But he sent you here to tell me to apologize.
163,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jonathan,Exactly. I penciled you in for 3:00. This conversation never happened.
164,1,4,Jack the Writer,PA,"Jenna, set yourself, please, for ""Who Wants to Eat a Dictionary?"""
165,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,Where's Kenneth?
166,1,4,Jack the Writer,Man,Who is it?
167,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,It's Kenneth from the NBC page program. I'm here for a pickup from Kyang Dang.
168,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Hello, gentlemen. Oh, thank goodness, air-conditioning. Ooh, what does that tattoo mean? When I get nervous, I ask a lot of questions. Do y'all have a bathroom I could use? Y'all have long fingernails. Now, do y'all rent this space, or do you own it? Hey! That's a funny-looking fish. What is that... like, a grapefruit knife? Do you have a cellphone? What's your plan?"
169,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,This apology thing is... interesting.
170,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, even when it's something normal, I hate going up to Jack's office. I always feel like I'm entering the Death Star. I expect to see stormtroopers. I'm telling you, if Donaghy does this at me, I will run."
171,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,You'll be fine... Captain Needa.
172,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"No, Captain Needa dies. He dies!"
173,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"ß There's no business like show business ß, ß Like no business I know ß, ß Everything about it is appealing ß, ß Everything the traffic will allow ß, ß Nowhere can you get that special feeling ß, ß Than when you're stealing that extra bow ß"
174,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,What can I do for you? I'm on a helicopter in 15 minutes.
175,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Uh... well, sir, I just wanted to say, um, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings the other day, when I asked you to stay out of the writers' room."
176,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,That's absurd. Completely unnecessary. I haven't given it a second thought.
177,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Okay, good, 'cause, you know, the writers, they see you as management."
178,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Please, it's water under the bridge. Stop worrying and just go on back to work."
179,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Right.
180,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Of course, I can understand, how you might think my feelings were hurt. No one wants to hear that people don't like you."
181,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"What? No, that... No, that's not at all what I was saying before. I never said that people don't like you. That's not true."
182,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,So people do like me?
183,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Yes, people like you."
184,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Do you like me?
185,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Of course. I like you, Jack."
186,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,You know what I like about you?
187,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Your eyes.
188,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"You have those... black... shark's eyes, you know? Very intense."
189,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Thank you.
190,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Anyway...
191,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"You done good, kid. That thing ever goes missing, and gets into the public water system, we don't know each other."
192,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,Got it.
193,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,I got one little errand for you to run.
194,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"Tomorrow's my anniversary, and I almost forgot about it."
195,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,"But what did I tell you was the secret, to having a good marriage and keeping it together, Kenneth?"
196,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Be a good listener, a giver of gifts, and work that vajayjay."
197,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,That's my boy.
198,1,4,Jack the Writer,Tracy,That's why I want you to go see my jeweler.
199,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Good morning, Liz."
200,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, hi, Mr. Donaghy. How are you?"
201,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Fine, thank you."
202,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"I remember you mentioning what a big fan you are, of the rapper Chamillionaire."
203,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, 'cause I was dancing with Frank? Oh, yes, yeah. I love Chamillionaire."
204,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Well, it just so happens, that he's performing this weekend at Webster Hall, and I got some V. I. P. tickets and backstage passes."
205,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"You could take the writers or a friend, whatever."
206,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Enjoy yourself. You deserve it.
207,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Wow, thank you. That's... that's very thoughtful."
208,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Well, I think that coworkers, should have good personal relationships."
209,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"I know we've had some missteps, but we've put all that behind us, and I'd like us to be... friendly."
210,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Yeah, absolutely, yes. So do I."
211,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Wow, I just can't believe Chamillionaire tickets, were still available."
212,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Ha, well... See you."
213,1,4,Jack the Writer,PA,"Josh to the stage, please, for ""Homophobic Gays."""
214,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,What was that about?
215,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Just talking to my bud Jack Donaghy.
216,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,Bud? Really?
217,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Yes, he said he wants us to be friends, he gave me Chamillionaire tickets, and he even did this to me."
218,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"Wow, well, look, having Jack on your side, can only make life easier. It's good for everybody if he wants to be friends."
219,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"I know, but it's so weird. It's like that scene where you see, the back of Darth Vader's head with his helmet off, and you're like, "" He's a human being."", I got to get some new DVDs."
220,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,Did we just go in a circle?
221,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Yeah, I was following you."
222,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,I was following you.
223,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"No, I'm going to wardrobe."
224,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"Okay, good walk and talk."
225,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Lee, can I check costumes for the cold open?"
226,1,4,Jack the Writer,Man,That looks fierce.
227,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"Hey, Liz."
228,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Cerie, seriously. Take that off. And, you, stop encouraging her. You're an enabler."
229,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"You need to dress like you have a job, and parents who raised you, in some kind of shame-based American religious tradition."
230,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Here.
231,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,I can make this hot.
232,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,Now I get to pick out what I think you'd look good in.
233,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Oh, I'm not really a fashion person."
234,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,You're wearing this.
235,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Come on, no."
236,1,4,Jack the Writer,Cerie,"I'm serious... this color would be amazing on you, and you're a size 4, right?"
237,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Well, aren't you sweet?"
238,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Hey, guys. What's up?"
239,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,Ugh!
240,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"Oh, my God!"
241,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,What...
242,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,What are you wearing?!
243,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,You're making me gay.
244,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"It's a joke, obviously. I'm wearing this as a joke. A bunch of comedy writers don't know a joke, jeez."
245,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,I just threw up in my mouth.
246,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,I said it's a joke!
247,1,4,Jack the Writer,Writer,"Work your ""thang."""
248,1,4,Jack the Writer,Lutz,I think I'm having a heart attack.
249,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Excellent. Right here. Thank you.
250,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Oh, pizza."
251,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"There you go. Thank you, sir."
252,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,Can we eat this out on the roof gardens?
253,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,I don't even know how to get out there. I don't think people are allowed out there.
254,1,4,Jack the Writer,Toofer,"No, I see ""Today Show"" people eating out there all the time."
255,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Really? Even Ann Curry?
256,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"I'll show you the studio in just a minute, but, first, this is where my writers write."
257,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Don't mind the odor.
258,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"But, seriously, since Tracy's arrival, the show is up in the key demos, we're driving male viewership, and we're effectively synergizing backward overflow."
259,1,4,Jack the Writer,Toofer,"Please, Liz. Let us eat outside."
260,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"You know what? I'll ask Jack. He'll let us eat out there, right? He and I have an important friendship."
261,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Hey, they didn't bring any sodas."
262,1,4,Jack the Writer,Pete,"I'll call Kenneth. Seriously, where is Kenneth?"
263,1,4,Jack the Writer,Kenneth,"Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Jordan. Excuse me, do y'all just have noodles with butter?"
264,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,reintegrate that position...
265,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Hey, Jack! Sorry to interrupt."
266,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Hey, can we eat our pizza outside? 'Cause those wangs from the ""Today Show"", eat on the roof garden all the time, you know?"
267,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"And I thought since me and you are best buds... boink... maybe you could do me a solid, and slip me the key to that thing."
268,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,This guy's the best. He got me kick-ass Chamillionaire tickets.
269,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,You guys like Chamillionaire?
270,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Anyway, Jack rocks. This guy... A-plus."
271,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Excuse me for a moment.
272,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,I'm sorry for what's about to happen right now. Just know that I don't mean it.
273,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,Don't mean what?
274,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"What group home did you escape from, that you would dare talk to me like some plumber's wife, in front of Ron Gordon and Bob Overmyer?"
275,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,I don't even know who those guys are.
276,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"Oh, really? Your ignorance was obvious when you waddled up to me, with your thin-lipped mouth full of greasy peasant food, and addressed me by my Christian name, in front of the gentlemen from Fairfield."
277,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"That's Fairfield, Connecticut, Lemon... G. E. Headquarters."
278,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"But how would you know that, with your nigh 40 years of public education, and daytime-television viewing?"
279,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,"If you ever pull a bush-league stunt like that again, I'm gonna have you, writing promos for Arena football so fast, it'll make your inexplicably small head spin."
280,1,4,Jack the Writer,Frank,"Oh, snap."
281,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
282,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,I thought you said we were friends.
283,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,I said we were friendly.
284,1,4,Jack the Writer,Liz,"Well, I don't like you anymore."
285,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,I don't believe you.
286,1,4,Jack the Writer,Jack,Go easy on the pizza.
287,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Why is there hair everywhere? Did you shave in the kitchen?
288,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,The water in here is softer.
289,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,Look at this ski-jumping idiot Bode Miller. What kind of a fruity name is Bode?
290,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"That cereal has the Olympics on it? That's, like, eight months old."
291,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"When you and me have kids, we're gonna give them good names like Shannon or Rick."
292,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,When we what?
293,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"When we have kids, dummy. Come on."
294,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Yeah, I got to go. Um... are you gonna be home later? I got to talk to you about something."
295,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,I'll be right here.
296,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"Look at this maze. It's so easy. I mean, come on, you go in here and out there."
297,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"I'll be home early, okay?"
298,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"Yeah, well... come here, sweetheart."
299,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Oh, Dennis, I just did my hair."
300,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"Aw, that's my girl. Yeah, bye."
301,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Nurse,"Now, make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get something to eat. Don't do anything strenuous tonight. Don't hit the clubs."
302,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"No, I'm going straight home, actually. I'm breaking up with my boyfriend tonight. I can't take it anymore."
303,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Nurse,"Hmm, 35, single, no children. Three sexual partners in the last 10 years. I don't know, doll. Maybe it's time to settle."
304,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Nurse,Chocolate chip or butter crunch?
305,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,I can't believe that this is happening to me. It's just not fair.
306,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,You're right. This business is unfair.
307,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,What happened?
308,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Jenna was supposed to be on the ""Conan"" show tonight, but..."
309,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,I got bumped.
310,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Oh, well, you know, that kind of thing happens."
311,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Jack bumped her and put Tracy on instead.
312,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Jenna, you can't let this kind of thing get to you."
313,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,I just feel like everything always gets taken away from me.
314,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"No, that's not true. What about that movie you did last summer?"
315,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,"""The Rural Juror""?"
316,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Yeah, ""The Rur..."" that one."
317,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Man,"""Rural Juror,"" apple 3, take one. Mark. It's a terrible title."
318,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Director,Action.
319,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,When does that come out?
320,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,"""The Rural Juror"" opens in selected theaters December 18th."
321,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,"Does Jack Donaghy even know I'm in ""The Rural Juror""? Maybe if he knew I have a film career, he would treat me with more respect."
322,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,PA,"Jenna to the set, please. Jenna to the set, please, for ""Rodney Stink, Confirmed Bachelor. """
323,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"I will tell him. I will tell him that you are in a feature film called ""The Rur Jur."""
324,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,What the hell's her movie called? I don't know.
325,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,She's been talking about it for a year. I can't ask her now.
326,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,I can't believe Jack did this to her!
327,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"I can't believe Conan's gonna have Tracy on as a guest again, considering what happened last time."
328,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,You seem like you have a nice chemistry...
329,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,I am a stabbing robot. I will stab you.
330,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,"All right, no, okay! All right, all right! That's great, Tracy! We'll take a break! We'll be right back!"
331,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Hey, Clarice, can I see Josh's Stone Phillips wig? Oh, great."
332,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Do you mind if I pop it on you, actually? I want to see the shape of it."
333,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Please. It would make my wife's dream come true.
334,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Oh.
335,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Yeah? Handsome?
336,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Yes!
337,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,You find me handsome?
338,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Yes, very much."
339,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"You know, I used to be very rich."
340,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Oh. Hello.
341,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Ooh, hi. Sorry."
342,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"I know you're wearing that as a joke, but it makes you look younger and more confident, and I think you should consider it."
343,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,Can I see you in my office?
344,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Yeah, hang on a second, actually. Why did you bump Jenna from ""Conan""?"
345,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,Because if I have a choice between an international movie star and a woman who does commercials for ShopRite...
346,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"No, no, no, Jenna doesn't do those commercials anymore. She got fired."
347,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"I don't do these things just to drive you crazy, Lemon. I do them for the good of the show."
348,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Well, I'm the one that always has to clean up the mess afterwards."
349,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,That's why my job is way better than yours. Way better.
350,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Conan, Tracy's really excited to be back on your show."
351,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,"I don't know, Jack. He's kind of a loose cannon, and I like to surround myself with people that don't try to stab me."
352,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Well, Tracy's feeling a lot better now. He's under a doctor's care."
353,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,"Yeah, that's what they said about Hasselhoff. Then he tried to make out with me during a commercial break."
354,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Conan, this is important to me, so we can either do this the easy way or the hard way."
355,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,What's the hard way?
356,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,You do a live Christmas Eve special from Kabul every year until the war on terror is won.
357,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,Tell Tracy I'll see him tonight... you Black Irish bastard.
358,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Back at you, red."
359,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,"I have to be charming on ""Conan"" tonight. This is my chance to redeem myself with mainstream America."
360,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Toofer,"Okay, well, just tell us some things about your life, and we'll try to punch it up and make it talk-show-worthy."
361,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Maybe something about you and your wife.
362,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,Me and my wife like to play rape. She go in the bathroom and do her hair. Then I put on a ski mask.
363,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Okay, not that."
364,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Frank,"Hey, uh, you got anything about being a dad? People eat that garbage up."
365,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,I like to walk around my house naked to remind my oldest son who's still got the biggest dingdong.
366,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,No.
367,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,"Oh, I could tell the story how I met Sharon Stone."
368,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Oh, what was that?"
369,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,I was pooping in the ladies' room at the lvy...
370,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,No.
371,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,My head hurts. Anybody gonna answer the phone?
372,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,What phone?
373,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,Is anybody gonna answer the phone? The phone! It's ringing. Brring! Brring!
374,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"So, you wanted to see me?"
375,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Oh, Lemon, wonderful. I'm introducing Jack Welch at a dinner at the Waldorf. What's a funny, little quip I could open with?"
376,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,That's why you called me up here?
377,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Okay, um, ""Good evening. ""It's great to be here at the beautiful Waldorf=Astoria. ""I haven't seen this many white people in tuxedoes since the Titanic. """
378,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Lemon, this is not open-mike night at the Bryn Mawr student union. This is a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser."
379,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Okay, um, how about, ""Wow, $1,000 a plate. ""For that kind of money, this stuffed chicken breast better paint my house."""
380,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Uh, let me, uh, tell you what I was thinking of saying."
381,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"""Jack Welch has such unparalleled management skills, ""they named Welch's grape juice after him, ""because he squeezes the sweetest juice out of his workers' mind grapes."""
382,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,That doesn't even make sense.
383,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"No, it doesn't, does it? I wrote it down in the middle of the night."
384,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Listen, I'll try to come up with something for you, but I got to get back downstairs. Tracy needs help."
385,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,Cookie in the middle of the day?
386,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,I gave blood.
387,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,Does that burn calories?
388,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,What else? What else is on my mind grapes?
389,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,"I could talk about how the moon is a spy satellite put there by Oprah and Minister Farrakhan, and not the Minister Farrakhan you're thinking of."
390,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,Who's that dude?
391,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Frank,"Uh, what dude?"
392,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,The blue dude. Tell him to stop staring at me. I don't like that dude. I don't like that dude.
393,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Blue Dude,Meep.
394,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Hey, guys."
395,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Toofer,That was weird.
396,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Hi.
397,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Frank,You missed it. Tracy was acting old-school bananas.
398,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,He's always bananas.
399,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Toofer,"No, this was different."
400,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Frank,"Yeah, like ""Conan should be afraid"" different."
401,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Oh, really? Where'd he go?"
402,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,I don't know.
403,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,"Yes, I am having problems with my cable television. Yes, I will hold. Excuse me, I have another call. Hi, Mom. I am doing fine."
404,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Ooh, that's not good."
405,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Aw, Frank, that was my blood cookie!"
406,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Frank,Ew. What?
407,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Hey, Jack Attack! Sorry, should have kept that one in the old brain box. Could you sign that for me, please?"
408,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Pete, where's your charisma?"
409,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,What?
410,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,The wig. I prefer that you wear it.
411,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Well, I thought you were joking."
412,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Well, let me clarify. I'm not joking."
413,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Pete, did you know that men with full heads of hair, on average, earn 17% more than their bald counterparts?"
414,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,I did not know that.
415,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,Perhaps it's because bald men are generally less informed than men with full heads of hair.
416,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,But here's what I want you to do. Wear the wig for a week and experience your full potential.
417,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Well, I-I think this is my full potential."
418,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"I know you're skeptical, Pete. I know."
419,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Here, I want you to do something. Pull my hair. Right now, go ahead, pull my hair. I'm just kidding."
420,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,It's... It's real. I'm not like you.
421,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,"So, be honest with me. What did Jack say?"
422,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Well, I guess he thinks that Tracy is a movie star, and he doesn't love it that you did those commercials."
423,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,"Well, you tell him that those commercials paid for my vacation home, so unless he would like to buy me a condo in Clearwater, Florida..."
424,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Jenna, I'm sorry. Just let it go. Tracy's doing ""Conan"" tonight."
425,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Grizz,Liz Lemon we got a problem.
426,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Grizz and Dot Com say Tracy's doctor put him on some new medication. I guess he's having some sort of reaction.
427,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Well, ""Conan"" tapes in..."
428,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Less than two hours.
429,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Call me if you need me.
430,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Tray, can I come in?"
431,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,I'm bugging out. I'm bugging out! I'm bugging out!
432,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Aah! Tracy, who is your doctor?!"
433,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,Dr. Spaceman! Dr. Spaceman!
434,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Oh, brother. Look around. We got to find his medication."
435,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,"Dr. Spaceman, Dr. Spaceman"
436,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Wow, ""Dr. Spaceman."" I owe you an apology, Tray."
437,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dr. Spaceman,This is Dr. Leo Spaceman.
438,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Hi, I work with Tracy Jordan, and I think he's having a reaction to some of the medication you put him on."
439,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dr. Spaceman,"Ugh. I was afraid this might happen. You know, he's on so many different neuroleptics and tricyclics that there's no telling how they'll mix. But what can you do? Medicine's not a science."
440,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Well, what exactly are you treating him for?"
441,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dr. Spaceman,"There's not really a name for what Tracy has. Basically, it's erratic tendencies and delusions brought on by excessive notoriety and certainly not helped by my wildly experimental treatments."
442,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dr. Spaceman,"Boy, I'm being awfully open with you, miss. I should not have taken those blue things."
443,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"So, is he dangerous?"
444,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dr. Spaceman,"No, he should be fine, so long as you keep him away from bright lights, loud music, and crowds."
445,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dr. Spaceman,"You know, I'll call in a prescription for something to settle him down as soon as possible. Um... do you need anything for yourself?"
446,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"What? No, just where can I pick up Tracy's prescription?"
447,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,"Miss Lemon, they need you upstairs in Mr. Donaghy's office immediately."
448,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Kenneth, I need you to go to Rite Drug, 46th and 8th. Pick up Tracy's medicine fast, okay? Yes, sir."
449,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,What is it? What's the emergency?
450,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"How's this for an opening line? ""When I first met Jack Welch, ""I thought he was such a great golfer, he made Bob Darnell look like Randy Barnes."""
451,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,That's fine. Do that.
452,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,I don't know. It might be distasteful if Randy's widow's in the audience. What did you come up with?
453,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"I have a bigger problem, Jack. I don't think Tracy's ready to do ""Conan."" I think you should let Jenna do it, and maybe Tracy could do it in a couple weeks."
454,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Jenna's not a star. She's capable, but she's not a star."
455,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,She got a movie coming out next month.
456,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,What movie?
457,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"""The Rur Jur."""
458,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,The what?
459,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Tracy's acting nuts. He's having problems with his medication.
460,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,Did you call Dr. Spaceman?
461,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Yeah, I did."
462,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,Then he'll be fine. Leo's an excellent physician and a pretty good dentist.
463,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Is that rehearsal? Oh, n... Oh. No, this... this Tracy situation is really..."
464,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Are we still talking about that? Do I have to come in and run your show, or could you take this one thing off my plate?"
465,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"No, I got it. I'll figure it out."
466,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,What?
467,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Don't ask.
468,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Who is this leader of men? What can I do for you, handsome?"
469,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,"Liz, I wanted you to be the first to know. After the way Jack treated me today, I can't work here anymore. I quit."
470,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Oh, Jenna, I really don't have time for this."
471,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,Then I guess this is goodbye.
472,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Okay, Jenna, don't quit. The show can't go on without you. You're my muse. You're a modern-day Lucille Ball. You're prettier than Debra Messing. Please don't quit."
473,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,"Well, if that's the way you feel, I'll stay."
474,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Ugh! It's Dennis.
475,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Do you have any food? I'm getting really low blood sugar.
476,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jenna,"Are you dieting finally? Tell me... what are you doing, South Beach, Master Cleanse?"
477,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Man,Hello?
478,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. Shoo."
479,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"Liz, hey, it's me, Dennis."
480,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Dennis, what do you want?"
481,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"You got to do me a huge favor. You got to call Ticketmaster right away. Nickelback just added another date, right? And I would do it on your computer, but I'm downloading a game right now."
482,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"No, I can't do that for you. Listen, just be home tonight when I get there, okay? I need to talk to you about something."
483,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,Word.
484,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,Blue Man! That blue dude keep following me!
485,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"All right, let's just get him down to hair and makeup. Hopefully, Kenneth will be back any minute."
486,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,Aah!
487,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,"Oh, my."
488,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,No! No! Aah! No! No!
489,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,It's the Blue Man. It's coming up on me.
490,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,There's no Blue Man.
491,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,Take the Blue Man! I don't want the Blue Man!
492,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"All right, all right, all right."
493,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,"Hey, Liz, what's up?"
494,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Oh, hi, Conan, how are you?"
495,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,Good. You still going out with that guy from the pager store?
496,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Who, Dennis? Yeah."
497,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"You still, um... How's your wife?"
498,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,"Let's not do this, Elizabeth."
499,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Okay.
500,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy," Nah, nah, nah Nah"
501,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Vocal warm-ups. I'll tell him you came by.
502,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,Okay.
503,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy," Uh, uh "
504,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Grizz,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. He licked all of those."
505,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,"After you, ma'am."
506,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Chewbacca, may I speak to Tracy, please?"
507,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,"Brrrrrr, brrrrr."
508,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,How's it going?
509,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,No! Past Pete is here to kill Future Pete!
510,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,It's going great.
511,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,No! Brrrrr.
512,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"It's all right, Tray! Come back!"
513,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Ladonica,Hi.
514,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,"Yes, ma'am, do you have a prescription for Mr. Tracy Jordan?"
515,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Okay, come on out of there, buddy."
516,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Oh, I almost forgot. Jack would like to see you up in his office."
517,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Ohh, I don't have time for this!"
518,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Yeah, Jonathan, tell him I've got my hands full with Tracy."
519,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,You sound upset.
520,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,I am upset.
521,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"Well, come on up, and we'll talk about it."
522,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Ugh!
523,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,Brrrrr.
524,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,"Fine, I will try the other location, but, frankly, Ladonica, you have not been real helpful."
525,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,We'll get to your problem in a minute. Have you had a chance to think of my zinger?
526,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"""Well, it's almost Thanksgiving, everybody, ""and I know what this crowd's giving thanks for... estate-tax reform."""
527,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"That is terrific. I really enjoyed that. But do you think it's too topical? Damn, I wish this event were tonight."
528,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,It's not tonight? When is it?
529,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,February.
530,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Why are you wearing a tux?!
531,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Jack,"It's after 6:00. What am I, a farmer?"
532,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,It's 6:00? No.
533,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Man,You're right after this commercial.
534,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,You can do this.
535,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Tracy,"Mr. Blue Man! You gonna tell me my feet stink? You don't even have feet, Blue Man! Blue Man, where your feet at?!"

549,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Man,"Okay, got to go. Excuse me. Oh! Tracy?"
550,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,Please welcome Tracy Jordan.
551,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"You know, you really went above and beyond for that guy today."
552,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,I just hope we get away with it.
553,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,This is going on a little long.
554,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Don't do... Don't do that.
555,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Pants on! Pants on!
556,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Sit in the chair, buddy."
557,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Sit in the chair. Sit down, sit. Oh!"
558,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"No, sit down."
559,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,Okay.
560,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Attaboy.
561,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,"Good to have you here. That was great, and you're... And he's asleep, which, uh, is okay, 'cause at least he didn't murder me."
562,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,"Uh, we'll take a break, and, uh, Tracy Jordan, everybody."
563,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,"Hey, you did good, kid."
564,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,You don't see that every day. Tracy Jordan.
565,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Give me that.
566,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Pete,Ow!
567,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,I really got to eat something.
568,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,I've lost track of it!
569,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Hey.
570,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,Hey. What's up?
571,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"I didn't know what you wanted, so I, uh, ordered you a cheeseburger."
572,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,"Oh, Dennis, thank you. Oh! Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much."
573,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"So, what did you want to talk to me about, huh?"
574,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Liz,Nothing. I forget. I just want to listen to you play Halo till I fall asleep.
575,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Dennis,"Oh, it's baloney! How'd that... How'd that grenade not kill him? He was standing right next to it! You know, Liz, this controller's defective. Liz?"
576,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,"Well, I got started in the NBC page program. And before you know it, I'm making hit movies with my good friend and roommate, Zach Braff."
577,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What? Who told you that?
578,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,"Well, yes, I do know how to clog, but I don't think anybody wants to see me do that. You do? Really? Okay."
579,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Conan,"You're a weird guy, Kenneth."
580,1,7,Tracy Does Conan,Kenneth,"See you tomorrow, Mr. O'Brien."
581,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,I thought Tracy was getting here at noon.
582,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Movie stars move at their own pace, Liz. We have to accommodate them."
583,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Yeah, well, a lot of people are still upset, about Tracy joining the show."
584,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,That's not my problem. I have other things on my plate.
585,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"You hear about that chemical-factory explosion, outside of Colorado Springs? No. Good."
586,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"I just think when it comes to this whole Tracy thing,, it's best to tread lightly."
587,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"No, no, no! No, no, no, no!, Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!, It's just us."
588,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Lemon, to tread lightly is your job."
589,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,My job is to keep Tracy Jordan happy.
590,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Girls, girls, girls, let's save it for Mr. Jordan."
591,1,2,The Aftermath,Kenneth,"Studio 6H is where we do ""The Girlie Show."", Did y'all see Tracy Jordan, make a special appearance the other night? Wasn't that exciting?"
592,1,2,The Aftermath,Kenneth,That is what we in the show business like to call a cameo.
593,1,2,The Aftermath,Kenneth,"Hey, this is the star of ""The Girlie Show,"", Jenna Maroney!, Hi. Thank you."
594,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"How you feel, NBC tour? Cause you look good, like a solid-gold candy bar."
595,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Where else do you have those piercings on your body?
596,1,2,The Aftermath,PA,"This is it, everybody. Here he comes."
597,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"No, no, no! Stop, stop, stop, stop."
598,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,It's only Jenna.
599,1,2,The Aftermath,PA,All right. It's just Jenna.
600,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"How you doing, Jenna?"
601,1,2,The Aftermath,Toofer,"Okay, I mean, granted,, Tracy Jordan has some commercial appeal, but within his remunerative body of work, there's just nothing of value."
602,1,2,The Aftermath,Frank,What are you talking about? Did you ever see his stand-up?
603,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Give up the butt, ladies. Give up the butt!"
604,1,2,The Aftermath,PA,This is it. I mean it. Here he comes!
605,1,2,The Aftermath,Toofer,He's an imbecile.
606,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,"Well, he's our imbecile now."
607,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,"I'm surprised he's still got his shirt... Oh, there it goes."
608,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Jack!, Oh, my goodness!, Good to see you again, brother!, It's good to see you again."
609,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Oh, that is fantastic. You'll have to teach me that handshake one day."
610,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Tracy, if there's anything you need,, anything, you come to me."
611,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Jack, man, you know I'm the kid."
612,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I'm easy like Sunday morning.
613,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Don't look at me. Do not look at me in the eyes.
614,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Do not look at Mr. Jordan. Do not look at him in the eye.
615,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Just look away. Look away.
616,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Tracy, this is our producer, Pete."
617,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Hey. Hey, Pete."
618,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"You smoke weed, right, Pete?"
619,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,Uh... No.
620,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Me neither.
621,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Me and you, Pete. Me and you."
622,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Pete. Good to see you.
623,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,"Is it? Oh, good."
624,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,"It's good to see you, too,, 'cause that means I'm not fired anymore. I wasn't gonna mention that, but I did. And now I'm talking about it."
625,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Relax your balls, Pete."
626,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Hey, everybody. Tracy Jordan's here."
627,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Don't just sit there. Come here and give me some sugar.
628,1,2,The Aftermath,Cerie,"No, thank you."
629,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"If you ever want to piss off your parents, you come see me."
630,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Right this way, Tracy."
631,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"This is Tim Grandy. He's from Bowie, Maryland."
632,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Rachel Bey. She just got engaged.
633,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Josh Girard. He got 760 on his SATs. Graduated from SUNY Cortland.
634,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Frank Rossitano has every copy, of Black Tail magazine ever published."
635,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,J. D. Lutz... thyroid problem.
636,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"James Spurlock... we call him Toofer,, 'cause with him, you get a two-for-one. He's a black guy and a Harvard guy."
637,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"And, of course, you know Lemon."
638,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,How did you do that?
639,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,It's my job.
640,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Jared from Set Design.
641,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Wally... Cue Cards.
642,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Rupert Murdoch.
643,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Melinda Gates.
644,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Ziggy from the cartoon ""Ziggy."", Anthony Pellicano."
645,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Heidi Klum.
646,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,The guy that sleeps with Heidi Klum.
647,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,This man's a genius.
648,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Let me just say, I'm excited to be here. It's an honor for you to meet me."
649,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I got a lot of characters I'm ready to bust out.
650,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I got a character named Biscuit. Write that up.
651,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Got another character named Rolando, who's a 2-foot-tall Spanish hustler. Glasses, I want you to write that one."
652,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Got another character named Ching-Chong, who loves to play ping-pong."
653,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I just made that up right now 'cause that's how I flow.
654,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Now, I'm up for anything."
655,1,2,The Aftermath,Josh,"Well, I thought me and you could play Seinfeld and Bill Cosby."
656,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,No. I don't like that.
657,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,How you doing?
658,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,There is no way I am working with that guy.
659,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Do you know that he once got arrested, for walking naked through LaGuardia?"
660,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Yeah.
661,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,And that he once fell asleep on Ted Danson's roof?
662,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Yeah, Tracy has mental health issues."
663,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,He bit Dakota Fanning on the face.
664,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"When you hear his version, she was kind of asking for it."
665,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,I-I can't even believe that you are doing this to me.
666,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Listen, I understand that this is tough for you, but what did I tell you?"
667,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Not to freak out?
668,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Right. And what else?
669,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Stop falling in love with gay guys?
670,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,About this.
671,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"But you're looking out for me, but it doesn't seem..."
672,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Jenna, I'm your friend."
673,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, okay?"
674,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"The show is called ""The Girlie Show,""and you are the girl. Nothing is gonna change that."
675,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Okay.
676,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Glaub mir. Dieser Advantium Microwave sind beste.
677,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,How could you change the name of my show without telling me?
678,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Detlev, I'm gonna have to call you back."
679,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Ja. Wunderbar. Plow chops.
680,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"""The Girlie Show""is now ""TGS with Tracy Jordan""?"
681,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,It tested very well with the focus groups.
682,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"If you say you like it, you can have some pizza. You people like pizza?"
683,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"You need to tell Jenna this whole thing was your idea, and I didn't know anything about it, and that she should be mad at you, not me."
684,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Oh, sure. Then we could sit around and braid each other's hair, until we get our periods at the same time."
685,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Lemon, you're a supervisor. These people are not your friends."
686,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Yes, they are my friends."
687,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,No. They're your employees.
688,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Well, one of my employees is extremely mad at me. Will you talk to her?"
689,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"No, because then you're not gonna learn anything."
690,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"You have to manage these people, Lemon."
691,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,It's your show. You have the tools.
692,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Get out there and build the house, add on the pool,, and throw yourself into the deep end."
693,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,What if I can't swim?
694,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Then I'll do what my father did when I was 2. Lure you to the edge of the pool with a puppy and push you in.
695,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Yikes.
696,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Fine. I'll figure it out.
697,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"We're gonna be shooting some promos in an hour, underneath the new sign."
698,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,So have your people... write some stuff.
699,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"So I said, ""Rick, this chick's got an Adam's apple."", And Rick said to me... I'll never forget this..."
700,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"He said, ""Freaky-deakies need love, too."", Freaky-deakies need love, too."
701,1,2,The Aftermath,Toofer,Charming.
702,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"So how you doing over there, Theo Huxtable?"
703,1,2,The Aftermath,Toofer,I'm doing good.
704,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Nuh-uh. Superman does good. You doing well.
705,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"You need to study your grammar, son."
706,1,2,The Aftermath,Frank,Wow. That was embarrassing for you.
707,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,I-I don't even have lines in these promos.
708,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,It's all Tracy. He doesn't even mention me.
709,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,I'll fix that. Just stay calm.
710,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Stay calm? They changed the name of the show.
711,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,You said you were looking out for me.
712,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,I am. I will handle it.
713,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Lemon. Lemon.
714,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Can I be real with you?
715,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Yeah.
716,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I haven't had a real job in like two years.
717,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I'm not used to all these cue cards and all of that.
718,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Don't worry about the cue cards.
719,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"You have two lines. You say, ""Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan. ""I'm bringing the black back to NBC. I'm proud as a peacock, baby."", You don't even need these."
720,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,You're right. I got this.
721,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Thanks for looking out for me, Lemon."
722,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I'm gonna crush it. Show these people how a movie star does it.
723,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"A little to your right, Tracy."
724,1,2,The Aftermath,Director,"Okay. Here we go. In 3, 2..."
725,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan. And I'm bringing the black back to NBC,, and I'm proud as a peacork, baby."
726,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"That's great, Tracy, but it's ""peacock."""
727,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,What'd I say?
728,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"""Peacork."""
729,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"""Peacock.""Think ""peacock."", Right, Jenna?"
730,1,2,The Aftermath,Director,"In 3, 2..."
731,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan. And I'm bringing the black back to NBC,, and I'm proud as a pea-cock, baby!"
732,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Okay, that time, I think you may have hit it a little bit too hard."
733,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Also, can you throw Jenna's name in there for me?"
734,1,2,The Aftermath,Director,"In 3, 2..."
735,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan. And I'm bringing the black back to NBC. Right, Jenna Malvaney?"
736,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Maroney... rhymes with baloney. Here we go.
737,1,2,The Aftermath,Director,"In 3, 2..."
738,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan. And I'm bringing the black back to NBC,, and I'm proud as a peacock, right, my baloney?"
739,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Nope.
740,1,2,The Aftermath,Director,"In 3, 2..."
741,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan. I'm black, NBC!, Very proud, like peacocks. Right, Janet?"
742,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I think we got it. I think we got it.
743,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Yeah. I think we did.
744,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,That was beyond insulting. The guy doesn't even know my name. Why do you love him so much?
745,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"No, no, no, no, no. I don't love him. Donaghy loves him, that's it."
746,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Pete can't stand him. Toofer thinks he's an idiot. Even Cerie says he's a pig.
747,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Frank likes his movies.
748,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Frank also loves that video, of the monkey smelling his own butt."
749,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Nobody wants Tracy Jordan here, except for certified non-genius Jack Donaghy."
750,1,2,The Aftermath,Kenneth,"I'm sorry to interrupt, Miss Maroney,, but the sound guys want their microphone back."
751,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,So everyone can...
752,1,2,The Aftermath,Kenneth,"Hear everything you're saying. Yes, ma'am."
753,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Oh, my God. I didn't use the N-word, did I?"
754,1,2,The Aftermath,Kenneth,"Oh, no, no, no, Miss Maroney, you did not."
755,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Oh, good. I mean, I never would, but..."
756,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Jenna, take the mike off! Sorry."
757,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Oh, my God. That was bad, right?"
758,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,It wasn't great.
759,1,2,The Aftermath,Cerie,Jack Donaghy wants to see you.
760,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"No, no. Tell him I'm very busy."
761,1,2,The Aftermath,Cerie,Come in. She's very busy.
762,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Mr. Donaghy, I sincerely apologize. I'm so embarrassed."
763,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"I guess you must be embarrassed, if you're hiding in the storage closet."
764,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,This is my office.
765,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Really?
766,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"I see you bring a little feminine magic, to everything you touch."
767,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,How did it go with Tracy Jordan when you apologized?
768,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Well, I didn't think I needed to talk to him. He's not my friend. He's my employee."
769,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"No, he's not your employee. He's your product."
770,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Like it or not, you're in the Tracy Jordan business now."
771,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"And when you screw the pooch the way you did today,, it's your responsibility to get in there and make things right."
772,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,How do I do that?
773,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,I don't know. I'm a non-genius.
774,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,I'm really sorry.
775,1,2,The Aftermath,PA,Lunch break. That's a lunch break. Back in 30 minutes.
776,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Tracy, uh, I hope I didn't hurt your feelings before."
777,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Please. You can't hurt me.
778,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I did stand-up on the road. Crowd once threw a motorcycle at me.
779,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Good, 'cause I'm just trying to calm Jenna down, 'cause she's kind of paranoid and neurotic. Your being here is just bringing out all of her crazy."
780,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,And please don't think that everyone hates you.
781,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Pete thinks that everybody's an idiot,, especially Frank, who is an idiot."
782,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Josh is just jealous, 'cause you're gonna get more screen time than him,, and Toofer's just afraid of black people."
783,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Which one is Toofer?
784,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,The black guy.
785,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Hmm.
786,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"My point is, don't worry about them. You are the only person that the network cares about."
787,1,2,The Aftermath,Kenneth," Miss Lemon, I just want to let you know,, y'all are on the monitors right now."
788,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Everyone can...
789,1,2,The Aftermath,Kenneth,"Hear you and see you. Yes, ma'am."
790,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Son of a... mother!
791,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Paranoid? Well, that just confirms all my suspicions."
792,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Sorry, everybody."
793,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Hey, buddies."
794,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"All right. I deserve that. But I didn't say anything about you guys, that I wouldn't have said to your faces."
795,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Fine. The important thing is, don't take this out on Tracy."
796,1,2,The Aftermath,Frank,That dude sucks.
797,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Are we gonna talk about this like adults,, or are you just gonna throw things at me?"
798,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,All right. Okay. Fine. Get it out of your system.
799,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"All right. Nothing that plugs in, you guys!, Nothing that could really hurt me!, Hello."
800,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Lemon?
801,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,How are things in the deep end?
802,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Fine.
803,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,The staff is meshing together well?
804,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Oh, yes. Yeah."
805,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Good.
806,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,I'm counting on you.
807,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,We got to do something.
808,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Let's crash my car to see if the air bags go off.
809,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Let me explain what I'm talking about first.
810,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Everybody is mad at us.
811,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Mostly mad at you.
812,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"That's because Donaghy threw me into the deep end of a pool, that I didn't even want to build in the first place."
813,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Look, I'm just saying, we both screwed up today."
814,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"I think we should make nice, and buy everybody some pizzas and some soft drinks."
815,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"No, no, no, no. This is what we're gonna do, Lemon."
816,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,You're gonna get everybody on my yacht.
817,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Harbor cruise, drinks, togetherness."
818,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,That's great. You have a yacht?
819,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"I got a yacht. I got a solid-gold Jet Ski, two Batmobiles,, the AIDS monkey's bones."
820,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Welcome! Welcome to your fantasy!, We're both hosting."
821,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,The ice-cream bar was my idea.
822,1,2,The Aftermath,Toofer,This is surprisingly tasteful.
823,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Oh, yeah. I've taken this boat many places... Miami, Tokyo, Denver."
824,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,"Hey, what does that mean... Avanti Domani?"
825,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,What?
826,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,The name of the boat.
827,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Oh, that's Spanish for ""remember your mother."","
828,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,"No, I don't think it is."
829,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Hello, boys. I brought champagne."
830,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,I'm so glad you came.
831,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Get away from me.
832,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,My baloney. Look at you. Wow.
833,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Yeah. Thanks.
834,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Let me make you a drink. You love apple martinis, right?"
835,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Yes. How did you know that?
836,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I read your interview in Amtrak Magazine.
837,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Really? You saw that?
838,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Mm-hmm. Wow.
839,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Hey, did you know all the writers in that magazine, are also conductors?"
840,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I didn't know that.
841,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Hey, Toofer, see if I got any schnapps."
842,1,2,The Aftermath,Toofer,Good gravy. This is a Dunwiddie '62.
843,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"It's for you. Take it, my friend."
844,1,2,The Aftermath,Toofer,Thank you.
845,1,2,The Aftermath,Frank,That is just wasteful.
846,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I hear you sing. I didn't know that.
847,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Why don't you sing something for me?
848,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Oh, no. Nobody wants to hear that."
849,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I do.
850,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Some folks like to get away ß, ß Take a holiday from the neighborhood, Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood,"
851,1,2,The Aftermath,Frank,Let's get out of here.
852,1,2,The Aftermath,Cerie, Is that a real song?
853,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"It's going well, right? It has to. It has to go well."
854,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,Relax. Everybody's having a great time.
855,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,How's Jenna?
856,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,"Furious and drunk, but at least she's getting along with Tracy."
857,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Well, he does know how to throw a party."
858,1,2,The Aftermath,Pete,Think we're ever gonna leave the dock?
859,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,I don't know. The engines have been running for like three hours.
860,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"Hey! Hey! Grizz!, Grizz, don't wreck this boat!"
861,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Grizz is driving the boat?
862,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Don't worry. He was in the Navy.
863,1,2,The Aftermath,Frank,I got one! I got one! Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.
864,1,2,The Aftermath,Josh,What's the deal with pudding?
865,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,I'm Bill Cosby. Jell-O. Sweaters.
866,1,2,The Aftermath,Josh,"Yeah!, That doesn't even sound like the Cos."
867,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,I got to go lay down.
868,1,2,The Aftermath,Josh,"Got you on that one, man."
869,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Pbht!, Tracy, thank you so much for doing this. You totally saved me."
870,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"You don't have to thank me, Lemon. We're a team now, like Batman and Robin,, like chicken and a chicken container."
871,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Hey, where's your bathroom?"
872,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,Second door on the right.
873,1,2,The Aftermath,Josh,Let's do another one. Let's do another one.
874,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Hmm. That's weird.
875,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Wow.
876,1,2,The Aftermath,Maid,"iPor favor! iNo me dueles! iMe llamo Maria!, Please, calling Ted and Nancy Peabody!, You tell ""Who Dat Ninja""is on the boat!"
877,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,What are you saying?
878,1,2,The Aftermath,Maid,"Tracy Jordan is on the boat!, He no see me!, I hidded from him... I hide from him!"
879,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,"Oh, my God."
880,1,2,The Aftermath,Tracy,"It's Spanish for ""remember your mother."", I've taken this boat to Denver. You can have that Scotch. Grizz was in the Navy."
881,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,It's not his boat!
882,1,2,The Aftermath,Police,"Sir, you need to disembark immediately!"
883,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,This is not his boat! We got to get off this thing! This is not his boat!
884,1,2,The Aftermath,Police,Disembark immediately!
885,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Is this your boat?
886,1,2,The Aftermath,Police,Disembark immediately!
887,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Run! Jump! Get out of here!
888,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Good morning.
889,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Morning.
890,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Okay. You were right.
891,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,I'm sorry?
892,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,I can't do this. I can't manage these people. It was a disaster.
893,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,What are you talking about? Everybody loved your little Lemon party.
894,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Nothing brings a team together like a harrowing experience.
895,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,You pulled it off.
896,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Really? They bonded.
897,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Good job.
898,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Okay.
899,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,I guess now I just have to read about how Tracy Jordan tried to steal a boat.
900,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,No. I took care of that.
901,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,The Peabodys will be getting some free rides in the NBC jet. There won't be anything in the papers.
902,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,Really? What about this?
903,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,"Well, I had to give them something."
904,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,Don't worry. She's gonna love it.
905,1,2,The Aftermath,Liz,That's just insulting.
906,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Liz, Liz, did you see me in the Post?"
907,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,"Oh, my God. It's so embarrassing."
908,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Look how thin I look.
909,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,And look how many e-mails I've gotten. It's not even 8:00 a. m. in L.A.
910,1,2,The Aftermath,Jenna,Oh! Should I call Stern?
911,1,2,The Aftermath,Jack,You're welcome.
912,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Hey.
913,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Hey, babe."
914,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Dennis, what are you doing?"
915,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,I'm gonna mount a TV on your wall. I just can't find a stud.
916,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,So you made nine holes in my wall?
917,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"No, those are for the shelves, dummy. The TV is gonna go right here. It's gonna be awesome. It's gonna be like a hospital."
918,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Dennis, I don't want a hospital TV. I don't want a shelf."
919,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Whose horse is that?
920,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,That's my cousin Teddy's Great Dane.
921,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,I told him I'd watch him for a couple weeks 'cause Teddy broke his ankle running from some black guys who pulled a gun on him.
922,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Why is it important to tell me that the muggers were black?
923,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,They weren't muggers. They were cops.
924,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,So why don't you just say he was running from some cops?
925,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"I don't know, I mean, you're a racist for assuming that they weren't cops."
926,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,You know I'm allergic to dogs.
927,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Ah, allergies are all mental."
928,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Hey.Who the hell is this?
929,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,That's Teddy.
930,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Get out. I want you out of here.
931,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,You can't kick me out. I love you.
932,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"No, no, get your stuff and get out. I'm not doing this anymore."
933,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,You can't kick me out. I got squatter's rights.
934,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Which is it... you love me or you got squatter's rights?
935,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,I don't see why they're mutually exclusive.
936,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Aargh!
937,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,Thank you.
938,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Oh, Liz, finally. It's about time you broke up with him. He's a complete loser."
939,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Oh, Jenna, don't say that. You know, he had some good moments."
940,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Hey, I got doughnuts."
941,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"What's up, brown eyes? I made chili."
942,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,Hey. You want to... want to order cheesesteaks?
943,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,I guess they were mostly food-related. But he was always nice to me.
944,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Oh, that's okay. Cry it out, sister."
945,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"No, I'm not crying. I'm allergic to the stupid Great Dane. That thing licked my eyes this morning."
946,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,Wait a minute... Dennis and the dog are still in your apartment?
947,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,I gave him a week to find a new place.
948,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,Ugh.
949,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"No, but we're completely broken up."
950,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"If that's true, then I'm taking you out to celebrate... a girls' night. We'll meet some new people."
951,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Oh, you mean like at a discotheque?"
952,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Oh, boy."
953,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"So, when can we see each other again?"
954,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"What are you wearing? Black dress? Black stockings? A funeral? Oh, I'm sorry."
955,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Okay. Let me call you back in an hour. Yeah, bye."
956,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,Why are you crying... did the Liberty lose again?
957,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,I'm not crying. I have allergies.
958,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Allergies are all in the mind, Lemon. I used to have a wicked peanut allergy, and now... witness."
959,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"As I'm sure you surmised from that call, I'm seeing a woman of late."
960,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Yeah, who's the lucky lady?"
961,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,Let's just say she's a high-ranking African-American member of the Bush administration.
962,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Are you dating Condoleezza Rice?
963,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,I'm not at liberty to say.
964,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"The point is, my lady friend is an egghead, much like yourself, not my usual thing, and I need your advice."
965,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,We're having a lot of trouble connecting lately. She does a lot of traveling.
966,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Yeah, and it must be hard for her to get cellphone reception when she's so far up the president's butt."
967,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"I'm choosing to ignore that remark on the basis that you are a godless, glassy-eyed Clintonista."
968,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Now, I wanted to get my friend something personal. Do you think that she would prefer this handsome attache, which says, ""You are a woman of substance and I respect you,"" or this collection of ladies' unmentionables with snaps and openings all over the place?"
969,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Attache!
970,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,I see. Okay.
971,1,8,The Breakup,PA,"Jenna to the floor, please."
972,1,8,The Breakup,Frank,"Yeah, it's pretty good. But I think the boobs should swing more."
973,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Yeah, then I could go, ""Rodney, don't make me come over there and beat you in the head with one of my boom-booms!"""
974,1,8,The Breakup,Frank,Yeah.
975,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,This is just appalling.
976,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,What's your problem?
977,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,I just think it's demeaning for a black man to do drag.
978,1,8,The Breakup,Frank,"What? Everybody loves a dude in a dress. I mean, those were the best ""Bugs Bunnies."""
979,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Frank, there are large pockets of African-American culture that Caucasians know nothing about. The stigma of drag is one of them."
980,1,8,The Breakup,TRacy,"Whatever. I played a woman before. ""honky Grandma Be Trippin""' made $96 million."
981,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"All I'm saying is, is drag is a way for Caucasians to emasculate you and make you seem nonthreatening."
982,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"We never would have stopped so low on ""Black Frasier."""
983,1,8,The Breakup,Josh,"""Black Frasier""?"
984,1,8,The Breakup,Fraiser,"Niles, this Beaujolais is impeccable. It's both fruity and precocious."
985,1,8,The Breakup,Frasier's Dad,That's not the only thing around here that's fruity and precocious.
986,1,8,The Breakup,Josh,"I never heard of ""Black Frasier."""
987,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,What? It was huge on BET. Every Thursday night at about 9:00 or 9: 15.
988,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Think about it, Tracy. All the best African-American comedians refuse to do drag. Chris Rock doesn't do it. Dr. Cosby doesn't do it."
989,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Bernie Mac doesn't do it, 'cause he'd be ugly as hell."
990,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,Forget it. I'm not wearing this dress. It's prejudicial.
991,1,8,The Breakup,Frank,Thanks a lot. Now what am I supposed to do with this sketch?
992,1,8,The Breakup,Josh,"I'll do it. I mean, my parents raised me as a girl for, like, 10 years. What? I told you guys that."
993,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,That's our show for tonight! See you next week!
994,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,Good night!
995,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Okay. No, that's okay."
996,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Sorry
997,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"All right, I'll see you later."
998,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,Monday night is girls' night. I'm taking you out... 9:30.
999,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,I know this great karaoke place where you can get a pedicure while you sing.
1000,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Oh, Jenna, I'll go anywhere, just, please, no more karaoke. Not after our last duet."
1001,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"When I'm right here, You need to be here, Not here, Here is embarrassing."
1002,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Okay, fine."
1003,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,I didn't say that. I said you're a beautiful woman. It wouldn't hurt to try something different with your hair.
1004,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Check this out... I think Jack is dating Condi Rice.
1005,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Oh, God! That's huge!"
1006,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Oh, no, no. I never said ""braces."" I said ""bonding."""
1007,1,8,The Breakup,Man,"Dude, that Shemanda character was the best thing of the night."
1008,1,8,The Breakup,Woman,What was her line? Say it again.
1009,1,8,The Breakup,Josh,"""Rodney! ""Don't make me come over there and beat on you with my boom-booms!"""
1010,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,You burned me!
1011,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"There's nothing wrong with a black comedian wearing a dress! Eddie does it. Martin does it. Jamie Foxx, Flip Wilson. Whoopi Goldberg does it every day!"
1012,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,You stole a franchise from me! Shemanda could have been a movie!
1013,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Okay, you need to write something great for him before this becomes a problem."
1014,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,I wouldn't even know where to begin writing for a guy like that.
1015,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Then write something with him.
1016,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,Our comedy got to do more than make people laugh. Got to make people think.
1017,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"I want to hold a mirror up to society and then win world record for ""biggest mirror."""
1018,1,8,The Breakup,Frank,He's totally right.
1019,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,Got to be raw!
1020,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Uh-huh. I got a concept for a sketch I think you might like. You and Jenna play Sleestaks from ""Land of the Lost,"" and you're trying to get a small-business loan."
1021,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,What?
1022,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Because you want to open up a pancake house called ""Slee's Stacks."""
1023,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,Are you black?!
1024,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Jack? Is everything all right?
1025,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,I think I figured out why things have been so rocky with my lady friend.
1026,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,I'm on the street. I can barely hear you.
1027,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"She's cheating on me, Liz. I think there's another man in the picture."
1028,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Are you sure, Jack? 'Cause she kind of seems like an honest lady."
1029,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"I know what I know. Next time I see Putin, I'm gonna kick his teeth in."
1030,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Oh! Here it is! ""lzzle... a suffix that can be used to take the place of anything."""
1031,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Well, now you're just being patronizzle."
1032,1,8,The Breakup,Frank,You know who would love this argument? My racist grandfather.
1033,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,I thought writing with you was gonna be like two brothers writing together. We're not even speaking the same language!
1034,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,That's right. I'm speaking English.
1035,1,8,The Breakup,Frank,Just listen. Just listen.
1036,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Come on. Who raised you? Standing there with your pants that fit, using a wallet, drinking Starbucks."
1037,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,And what is this?
1038,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"That's my Harvard a capella group, The Crocodillos. I had a solo in ""Like a Prayer."""
1039,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Come on. Where's your heritage? My brother, my homeboy, my n..."
1040,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Hey, sorry I'm late."
1041,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Well, thank God you're here. This place is creeping me out.  don't think I can do this."
1042,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,You're gonna be great.
1043,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,They're cute. Do you think they're Wall Street guys?
1044,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Yeah, I think they're from the firm of Date Rape, Cokington, Cheeseball, and Jag."
1045,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,You've got to give this a chance.
1046,1,8,The Breakup,Man,Excuse me. Is this seat taken?
1047,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Really, dude? I got to move my coat? There's like four empty seats down there. Can't you just be cool?"
1048,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,That guy wanted to buy you a drink.
1049,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Really? I already have a drink. Do you think he'd buy me mozzarella sticks?
1050,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,What is the matter with you?
1051,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,I don't know. I'm just nervous and rusty.
1052,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Well, just relax and be yourself."
1053,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Can I have a martini, please? Hi."
1054,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Oh, he knows where Bin Laden is, come on! The Carlyle Group, the Unocal pipeline, the assassination of Olaf Palme? Come on. The proof is in the pudding."
1055,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Ooh, these are good."
1056,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Really, you think she looks like Jessica Simpson? You could put a long blond wig on a ferret and it would look like Jessica Simpson."
1057,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"And by the way, Jessica Simpson would think that you are old and gross, so good luck with that."
1058,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"I really didn't think I was gonna meet anybody tonight, but you and I have so much in common. Also, you have really pretty eyes. Oh, hi."
1059,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,I learned the truth at 17 That love was meant for beauty queens
1060,1,8,The Breakup,Man,"Hey, you're bumming us out!"
1061,1,8,The Breakup,,And high-school girls with clear-skinned smiles Who married young and then retired Whoa
1062,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,I thought bars were open till 4:00.
1063,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Nope, 11:30. Let's get you to bed."
1064,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Uh, I see you've all met Norman from Human Resources. He tells me that Toofer has filed a harassment complaint against Tracy."
1065,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,What?
1066,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,Now I have to attend sensitivity training.
1067,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"What seems to be the problem, Toofer?"
1068,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,Mr. Jordan called me... the N-word.
1069,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,And?
1070,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,And I was really offended.
1071,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Because...
1072,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,Because it's a racial slur.
1073,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,Brothers talk to other brothers like that. I was being friendly.
1074,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Yes, Toofer. You see, in the last decade or so, the African-American community has reappropriated that word as a way of depriving it of its meaning. Just don't try to tell my girlfriend that."
1075,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Yeah, Toofer, I really don't think Tracy was trying to offend you."
1076,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,It's okay for us to use it with each other. You could call me that. It's a term of endearment.
1077,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Look, I'm not trying to cause any trouble, and I confess, I appreciate what you do for the show. I want you to be my brother, my homeboy, my n..."
1078,1,8,The Breakup,All,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
1079,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,This meeting is adjourned.
1080,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Not cool, homey! You might as well spray me down with a fire hose."
1081,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,It just sounds so hateful coming from you! Ugh!
1082,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,I wish to file a complaint.
1083,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,Hey.
1084,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Dennis, what are you doing here?"
1085,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Hey, I'm moving into my new apartment, so... I got one last thing to say to you, and then I'll be out of your life forever."
1086,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"""Dear Liz Lemon, While other women have bigger boobs than you, no woman has as big a heart. When I saw you getting ready to go out and get nailed by a bunch of guys last night, I knew for sure it was over between us. And for the first time since the '86 World Series, I cried. I cried like a big, dumb homo. And if it was up to me, we would be together forever. But there's a new thing called 'women's liberation,' which gives you women the right to choose, and you have chosen to abort me, and that I must live with. So tonight when you arrive home, I'll be gone. I officially renounce my squatter's rights. I'll always love you. Goodbye and good luck. I'll never forget you."
1087,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,And that is why we are no longer a couple.
1088,1,8,The Breakup,Frank,The guy just came in here and bared his soul to you.
1089,1,8,The Breakup,Cerie,"What are you, made of stone?"
1090,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Am I crazy? The guy's a disaster, right?"
1091,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"I-I don't know. I mean, he's a little bridge and tunnel, but you did say you had some good times."
1092,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"No, no, no, no. He had his bad moments, too."
1093,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Hey. Threesome? How about it, huh?"
1094,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"I'm just saying, after last night, maybe he's not such a bad choice."
1095,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,You are suggesting that I get back with Dennis.
1096,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,"Maybe. Look, you're a writer. Write a list of Dennis' pros and cons."
1097,1,8,The Breakup,Jenna,It's a very helpful exercise. It's how I decided to get a scooter instead of a bike.
1098,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Ah.
1099,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Well, you have to admit there's always time for Tony Blair, there's always time for Bashar al-Assad, but there's never any time for Jack Donaghy, and that's a problem. Go ahead. Take the call, yeah."
1100,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Hey, Dennis. You drop by to say hi to Liz?"
1101,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,You mean the ex-future Mrs. Dennis? She dumped me again.
1102,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,I'm sorry to hear that.
1103,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"You try to make some people happy, but it doesn't work all the time."
1104,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,Tell me about it.
1105,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"What, you?"
1106,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"I really can't go into details, but when my woman and I are together, it's mind-blowing."
1107,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"It's... It's filthy, really."
1108,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"So, what's the problem?"
1109,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,She works all the time. She's always traveling. It's a headache. Who needs that? That's why I'm always dating 20-year-olds.
1110,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Let me tell you about 20-year-olds, my friend. Half of them are 16."
1111,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"You want some advice? It's hard for alpha males ike you and me to put our egos aside, but if she's worth it, you make it work."
1112,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"It's like my cousin Teddy's dog. Sometimes, he just doesn't want to lick my feet. So what I do is I hide my feet from him for a couple of days, and then when he sees them, he goes bananas."
1113,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"So, Jack, in this example, Liz is the dog, and I am my feet. You see what I'm saying?"
1114,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Yes, I believe I do."
1115,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,"Each of you is here because you were insensitive to a coworker, okay?"
1116,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,"You might have used one of the words I call the ""uh-oh"" words, such as ""slut,"" ""ho,"" uh, ""bitch,"" ""bee-yatch,"" ""queerburger,"" ""fag-o-tron,"" ""gay bird,"" the word for ""black"" in any language... nero, noir, schwartz, negro, kanjan sec. Hmm?"
1117,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,"So, what else? What else can we not call each other?"
1118,1,8,The Breakup,Man 1,"How about ""sweaty greaseball""?"
1119,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,"Ooh, very good. That's highly offensive."
1120,1,8,The Breakup,Man 2,"""Person of color."""
1121,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,I guess if you say it like that.
1122,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"""Sneaky Taiwanese trannie who stole my watch."""
1123,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,"Yes! These words are terrible, but today, we are going to learn to communicate in a different way."
1124,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,And I would like to start... with Tracy and James.
1125,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,"Guys? Now, I understand that the two of you got into a big, old conflict yesterday. And... let's work this out."
1126,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,"Tracy, what did you really want to say to James?"
1127,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,I'm trying to tell him he's my brother. We're the only two blacks on the show. We have to figure out a way to work together.
1128,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Like Professor Martin Luther King said, ""I have a feeling."""
1129,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"It is Dr. Martin Luther King, and he did not ""have a feeling."" He had a dream."
1130,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Ah, dude wears khakis. Uncle Tom, party of one! Uncle Tom, party of one!"
1131,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,You can't call someone that if you've never read the book!
1132,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,What book?
1133,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"You know what I think? I think you're ashamed of being black, and you're an embarrassment to your community."
1134,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"I embarrass you? You embarrass me, and do you know why?"
1135,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Because there are racist people in this world, and when they see you act like a fool, they assume we're all fools."
1136,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,That's it! This is it! This is the sketch we should do!
1137,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,What?
1138,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Right here, you and me! This is deep stuff going on! We got to write this!"
1139,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,You're right.
1140,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Dr. Snew, thank you very much!"
1141,1,8,The Breakup,Dr. Snew,"Okay, okay, okay! That's really against the rules."
1142,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Dennis? Oh, my God."
1143,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"""I know this might be emotional for you, so there's a meatball sub in the fridge."""
1144,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"""Pro. Fixed TV."" Huh."
1145,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Hello, I'm Star Jones, and welcome to ""The Star Jones Gastric-Bypass Cooking Show."" Mmm!"
1146,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Liz, what happened to the race-relations sketch Tracy and I wrote?"
1147,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"We only had time for one more bit, and Tracy picked this one."
1148,1,8,The Breakup,Tracy,"Now, you know I can only eat small portions! Oh, my goodness. Dessert!"
1149,1,8,The Breakup,Toofer,"Okay, he's right. This is funnier."
1150,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,Guess where I was last night.
1151,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Mark Foley's pajama party?
1152,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,No. Kandahar.
1153,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Afghanistan?
1154,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,Yeah. Took the corporate jet to hook up with my neocon inamorata.
1155,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Well, I'm glad things are working out for you and your mystery lady."
1156,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Actually, they're not. I broke up with her."
1157,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Really? What happened?
1158,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Well, I finally realized that we're not compatible. I mean, I'm all for fantasy role-play, but Abu Ghraib?"
1159,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Well, you know, relationships end. People move on."
1160,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,But I'm glad at least I gave it a shot. Thank Dennis for making me do that.
1161,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Dennis?
1162,1,8,The Breakup,Jack,"Yep. You know, I might have been too hard on that guy. He's okay."
1163,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Hmm. ""Jack likes Dennis."""
1164,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"""Jack... likes... Dennis."""
1165,1,8,The Breakup,TV,"At Snapple, when young fruit ripen, they..."
1166,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Hey.
1167,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Hey. I just, um... I just wanted to drop off your Christmas present. I had already bought it for you, so..."
1168,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"It's a fancy briefcase because you're classy and important, like a dude."
1169,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Thank you, Dennis."
1170,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,I also got you some antihistamine in case the next guy you're with has a dog and you want to stay with him. Anyway...
1171,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Do you want to eat?
1172,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,What?
1173,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,I got all this Chinese food. I'm never gonna finish it by myself.
1174,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,For real? Should I grab a plate?
1175,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Yeah. Get me a diet soda.
1176,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,Okay.
1177,1,8,The Breakup,TV,"Good evening, and welcome to ""Dateline."" Chris Hansen has our latest investigation."
1178,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,Hello?
1179,1,8,The Breakup,Chris Hansen,"Good evening, sir. I'm Chris Hansen with ""Dateline NBC."" Can I ask you what you're doing here?"
1180,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Yeah, I'm here to boff some chick named Mary."
1181,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Oh, my God!"
1182,1,8,The Breakup,Chris Hansen,Do you know how old Mary is?
1183,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"22, I think."
1184,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Crap. That girl said she was 16, but I swear to God, I could tell she was 22."
1185,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,Get out of my apartment!
1186,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,This happened while we were broken up.
1187,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"Oh, no, no, no. I was right about you!"
1188,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,"This is a con, by the way. You on ""Dateline"" is a con!"
1189,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,You know what? I knew you wouldn't be cool about this. We're finished.
1190,1,8,The Breakup,Liz,You can't break up with me! I already broke up with you!
1191,1,8,The Breakup,Dennis,"Fine, then we agree to disagree!"
1192,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,PA,"Tracy Jordan to the stage, please. Tracy to the stage."
1193,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going? They're paging you for rehearsal."
1194,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Rehearsal? We just did a show last week. I just came to pick up a paycheck.
1195,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"No, we do a show every Friday, Tracy."
1196,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"It's not gonna work. Next Friday is Damon Dash's birthday party, and the Friday after that is an orgy over at Elizabeth..."
1197,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Yeah, well, you're part of a team now, okay, so you have to be in the shows and you have to rehearse."
1198,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"And when you rehearse, Jenna would really like it... I would like it, too... if you would read exactly what's on the cue cards. It's making everybody crazy."
1199,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Can't do it. I'm an improviser. My acting style is like jazz... jazz that you laugh at.
1200,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Just try, okay?"
1201,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,I have a meeting upstairs. I'll be right back.
1202,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Pete, do you remember that song I recorded last year when I was dating that Persian record producer?"
1203,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,Oh... no.
1204,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"It's a dance-pop-techno hybrid called ""Muffin Top."" I gave everybody copies at Christmas."
1205,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Oh, yeah, right. I don't remember that."
1206,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Well, apparently, it's a number-one hit in Israel."
1207,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Hey, Israel. Wow."
1208,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"I noticed we had a couple minutes left, so I thought I could do it on the show."
1209,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Okay, you can do the short version."
1210,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"You should know that ""Muffin Top"" is number four in Belgium."
1211,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,I said you could do it.
1212,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Why not? Oh. I mean thank you.
1213,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Hello. For over 100 years, G. E. has been imagining the future today."
1214,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,And I'm here to talk to you today about a wonderful new synergy. It's called product integration.
1215,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,It's revolutionizing the way we monetize broadcast television.
1216,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,How does it work? Simple.
1217,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"All you have to do as the writing staff of an NBC show is incorporate positive mentions, or ""pos-mens,"" of G.E. products into your program."
1218,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"For example, you could write an episode where one of your characters purchases and is satisfied with... one of G.E. 's direct-current drilling motors for an offshore or land-based project."
1219,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Product integration... setting a new standard in upward revenue-stream dynamics... for all of us.
1220,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Now, I'd be happy to answer any questions."
1221,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,I'm sorry. You're saying you want us to use the show to sell stuff?
1222,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Look, I-I know how this sounds."
1223,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"No, come on, Jack. We're not doing that. We're not compromising the integrity of the show to sell..."
1224,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Wow, this is Diet Snapple?"
1225,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"I know. It tastes just like regular Snapple, doesn't it?"
1226,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Frank,You should try Plum-A-Granate. It's amazing.
1227,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Cerie,I only date guys who drink Snapple.
1228,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Look, we all love Snapple. Lord knows I do, but focus here. We're talking about product integration."
1229,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,We're not your shills.
1230,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry. That's right. They're artists, like James Joyce or Strindberg."
1231,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Get real, kids. You write skits mocking our presidents to fill time between car commercials."
1232,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"That's not fair. Josh gets a lot of fan mail for ""Gaybraham Lincoln."""
1233,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Josh,"""Four score and seven beers ago..."""
1234,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Did you guys know that Holland is the only country with a national dog?
1235,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"I didn't know that. Thank you, Snapple."
1236,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,There's little facts
1237,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,PA,"That's a lunch break, everyone. Back in an hour, please."
1238,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Um, did you talk to Tracy about reading the cue cards?"
1239,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,I tried.
1240,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Well, he's not reading them. He never reads them, Liz."
1241,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,I'm starting to think... he can't read.
1242,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, that... That's just offensive, Jenna."
1243,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,I don't know. Have you ever seen him read anything?
1244,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Of course, like when we shoot promos."
1245,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan. I'm black, NBC... very proud, like peacocks. Right, Janet?"
1246,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Hmm.
1247,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Hey, Tracy. I missed that last run-through. Could you run it once off cards for me?"
1248,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Nah, Lemon. I'll do that later. I got to bounce."
1249,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Okay, that's a..."
1250,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"It says ""emergency exit only."" He couldn't read that?"
1251,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Frank,"Man, Jenna's really gotten squirrelly since Tracy came along."
1252,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Toofer,It's so sad.
1253,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Frank,"What's really sad is that, while she's in this fragile state, none of her friends are messing with her head."
1254,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Toofer,I think we should do something about that.
1255,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Toofer,"Oh... Okay, all right..."
1256,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Hey, what are you guys talking about?"
1257,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Frank,"Oh, uh... nothing."
1258,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,What? Is it about me?
1259,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Toofer,"Okay, um, there's a rumor going around that Donaghy has to cut costs around here."
1260,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Oh.
1261,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Frank,"Yeah, my friend in accounting, Lando Calrissian, he says Jack's probably gonna have to fire an actor."
1262,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Oh, thank you guys for telling me."
1263,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Toofer,It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
1264,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Frank,"Yeah, if the fish have Daddy issues."
1265,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,I can't believe you guys actually wrote a product-integration sketch.
1266,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Jack said we had to.
1267,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,It just seems weird. The show's not a commercial.
1268,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Snapple,"Excuse me. Can you tell me where human resources is, please?"
1269,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Snapple,That way. Thanks.
1270,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"This is gonna sound crazy, but, um... Tracy can read, right?"
1271,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,Are you serious? The guy's done dozens of movies.
1272,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Yeah, but it's not like his movies seem like he's reading a script."
1273,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Let's go rescue Karen... or whatever. Is it Sheryl?
1274,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Then she can tell us where the drugs are... I mean gold.
1275,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Then we got the car chase. I'm getting way too old for this. Was I supposed to say that then?
1276,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,That's true. And he never reads the cue cards.
1277,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"God, I thought all that stuff was just crazy Tracy, seeing what he could get away with."
1278,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"I know, but, you know, it's not surprising. Look at the educational system in this country. We spend all this money in Iraq, but meanwhile, our inner-city graduation rates are lower than they are in the Sudan."
1279,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,That doesn't sound right.
1280,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Maybe it was Sweden. Maybe it was teen pregnancy. I got to read more.
1281,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,What can I do for you?
1282,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"So, we wrote a product-integration sketch."
1283,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Good.
1284,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"But we wanted to run it by you first because it's about how G. E. is making us do this, and we were kind of hoping that the G. E. executive in the sketch could be played by you."
1285,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Oh, I get it... the whole self-referential thing."
1286,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Letterman hates the suits, Stern yells at his boss, Nixon's ""sock it to me"" on ""Laugh-ln."""
1287,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Yeah, hippie humor."
1288,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,That's what I'm going for.
1289,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"As you know, I've been studying comedy and learning what's funny."
1290,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"I'm watching ""Friends"" right now. What happens with Ross and Rachel? No, no, don't tell me... seriously. What were you saying?"
1291,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"So, will you do it?"
1292,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"I don't know, Lemon. I'm not an actor. This is... your world."
1293,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, come on. You can do this. You were great in that video. Yeah."
1294,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,This is live television. I've never done anything like that before.
1295,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Okay, I'll do it."
1296,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Great, great. Thanks, Jack."
1297,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"So, rehearsal will be tomorrow at 2:00. Please don't be late. I will fax you any changes by 9:00 a. m."
1298,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,You're such a Monica.
1299,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,You are.
1300,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,He never reads anything.
1301,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Uh, why is Jack Donaghy on the cast list?"
1302,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,He's gonna do this G. E. sketch. It's really funny.
1303,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"So he gets to be in sketches, but he's gonna fire one of the real actors."
1304,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,What?
1305,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,I got inside information that Jack is gonna fire one of the actors to cut costs.
1306,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,I haven't heard anything like that. Don't worry about it.
1307,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Oh, I'm not worried"
1308,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,because I have something the other actors don't... a secret weapon.
1309,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Don't say your sexuality.
1310,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,My sexuality.
1311,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, God, Jenna, when has that ever worked?"
1312,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Uh, when has it not worked?"
1313,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Host,lt'll be a 45-minute wait.
1314,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Oh, will it?"
1315,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Host,"Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it will."
1316,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Yeah, but this is different because I know Jack Donaghy. I know what he likes."
1317,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Yeah, so now you just have to make yourself 10 years younger and Asian."
1318,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,I don't know what to tell you. They're making me rehearse. I know Pat Benatar rarely performs live. Scalp the damn tickets!
1319,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,These are the changes for the sketches you're in.
1320,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Cool. I'll read those later, Lemon."
1321,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Tray... can you read?
1322,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Can I read?
1323,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Please don't get angry. It's not your fault. It's the system.
1324,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Did you ever see ""Hoop Dreams""? It's like that."
1325,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,So you're asking me if I'm illiterate?!
1326,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"You don't even have to answer me if you don't want to. Just know that if you need a tutor, we will get you a tutor."
1327,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"If you need to be in fewer sketches until you get more confident, we'll accommodate you... whatever you need."
1328,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"So I could, like, leave work early if I need a tutor?"
1329,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Absolutely. We'll work around your schedule.
1330,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"I can't read, Liz Lemon! My shameful secret is out."
1331,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Now you know why I'm always running into the ladies' bathroom.
1332,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"I can't read! I sign my name with an ""X""! I once tried to make mashed potatoes with laundry detergent!"
1333,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,I think I voted for Nader! Nader!
1334,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"I feel as though a great weight has been lifted off of me, Liz Lemon. Today is the first day of the rest of my life... all thanks to one very, very special white lady."
1335,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,I'll be in late tomorrow.
1336,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Damn, George Will just gets more and more conservative."
1337,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jonathan,Liz?
1338,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,Hey.
1339,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jonathan,Did you tell Jack he can be on the show?
1340,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Yeah, he was kind of excited about it, actually."
1341,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jonathan,"Oh, yeah, he's very excited. But you cannot put him on live TV."
1342,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Why?
1343,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jonathan,Okay. I am only showing you this because I care about him so much.
1344,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Man,"G.E. promo, take one."
1345,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,Action!
1346,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Did you say ""action""?"
1347,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,"Yes, action."
1348,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Could you say it louder, please?"
1349,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,I'm sorry. Action!
1350,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Man,"G.E. promo, take two."
1351,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Hello. For over 100 years... Line? Sorry. My bad. What's the first line?
1352,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,Product integration.
1353,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Okay. Right, got it. I just need the first word."
1354,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,"""Product."""
1355,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,What's the second word?
1356,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,"""Integration."""
1357,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Okay, I knew that. Okay, if I ask for the line again, don't tell me."

1359,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,"""Product integration."""
1360,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"I told you, don't give me the line when I ask for the line."
1361,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"l- I got it, I got it."
1362,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Can we get a do-over there?
1363,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Let's go again. Can we?
1364,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,What?
1365,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,What is it?
1366,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"I don't like this at all. Okay, I got it."
1367,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Let's go again.
1368,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,The pen doesn't really write. Does that matter?
1369,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,And I'm here today... My bad. I'm sorry.
1370,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Why don't we go to lunch, and we'll come back and maybe... Let's all go have lunch."
1371,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Man,G.E. promo 126.
1372,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"It's weird. What do I do with my arms? I've never thought about that before. Is it this... or, if I may... this?"
1373,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Maybe I should just hold something.
1374,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Okay, yeah. This feels more natural. Is that right? Yeah?"
1375,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"""New synergy..."""
1376,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Does that sound odd to anyone else? Does that sound like ""news energy?"""

1378,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,I'm here to talk to you television about the monetizing of today broadcast.
1379,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Was any of that usable?
1380,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Man,G.E. promo 129.
1381,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"It's called racial integration. No, that's not right, is it?"
1382,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"It's called product intergor... ""intergortion""?"
1383,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,...the way we monetize broadcast television. How does it work?
1384,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Oh. Could we turn off the phones, please? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's me."
1385,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Let me turn this thing off. I think I just took a picture.
1386,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"I'm sorry, everybody, there's a pigeon. Shoo!"

1390,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,Cut. That's a wrap.
1391,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Ha. That was fun, you guys. It didn't feel like five days, did it?"
1392,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,"Uh, no... No."
1393,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Everybody have a good weekend.
1394,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,And we'll be right back.
1395,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,PA,"Jenna to the stage, please. Jenna to the stage for ""Muffin Top."""
1396,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Hey, Liz? Liz, um, I'm a little bit nervous about this rehearsal."
1397,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, I'm... I'm glad you brought that up. You don't have to do this. I know how busy you are."
1398,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Oh, no, no, I have to do it. It's a new challenge, and I like challenges."
1399,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"I've summited Kilimanjaro. I've showered with Greta Van Susteren. I... I'm gonna do this, yeah."
1400,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jonathan,"The time, sir.."
1401,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Oh, that's right. Do you mind? We'll do it around the corner, okay?"
1402,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,I'll be with you in a minute. I have a conference with my corporate division head.
1403,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, yeah, you guys gonna correlate overseas earnings-report dynamics?"
1404,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Yes.
1405,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Liz? Did I just hear Jack?
1406,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, no, please. I know for a fact he is talking to his boss right now."
1407,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Really?
1408,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Don't bother him.
1409,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Fine.
1410,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Don't.
1411,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Of course, sir. I'll look into it right away."
1412,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,Actions speak louder than words. Take care of it.
1413,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Don't worry, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning."
1414,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,"Look, I am tired of your promises. I want this thing fixed."
1415,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"I'm... I'm on it, sir."
1416,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"So, you're Jack's boss, huh?"
1417,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,"Oh, well, yeah, that... that's what they tell me."
1418,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"I'm Jenna, by the way."
1419,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,"Oh, I, uh, I-I know who you are. I'm Ron."
1420,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Oh, Ron. How do you take your coffee, Ron?"
1421,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,"I take it, uh... I t-take it, uh... with t-the nondairy creamer."
1422,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Mmm. Yeah... nondairy creamer.
1423,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Yum. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, yeah."
1424,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,"Well, uh..."
1425,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Director,"Quiet, please! Rehearsing from Mr. Donaghy's entrance."
1426,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"What's up, Mr. Donaghy?"
1427,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Uh, oh, that's Josh's line. Your lines are in blue."
1428,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,My bad. I'm sorry. Those cards are a little confusing.
1429,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Hello... everyone. Thanks for waiting, please. Sit... down."
1430,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Okay, that's great. Just one thing, sir. You're looking into the camera a little bit."
1431,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"No, I'm not. I-I want to, but I'm not, no."
1432,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Could I get two coffee cups?
1433,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Yeah, you know, let's take five minutes, actually, everybody, while we get Mr. Donaghy some coffee cups."
1434,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"I know you want to do this, but I don't think it's working out."
1435,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,I agree. It's the writing. It's not natural.
1436,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Really? You think the problem is the writing?
1437,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Yeah, it's clunky."
1438,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Wow. Well, I was really trying to help you out of this. But you know what? You're the boss."
1439,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,I think I can do it.
1440,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"No, you should definitely do it. It'll be hilarious."
1441,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Well, that would be a refreshing change of pace for the show, wouldn't it?"
1442,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Excuse me.
1443,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,Why would Tracy pretend to be illiterate?
1444,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,To get out of coming to work.
1445,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"So first you thought he was illiterate, and now you think he's lazy? Jeez, you are racist."
1446,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"No, Tracy took advantage of my white guilt, which is to be used only for good, like overtipping and supporting Barack Obama."
1447,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Sha mon!
1448,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Hey, Tray, Kenneth told me you finally got into work."
1449,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Yeah, I had to go to reading class."
1450,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"You hear this mess about sometimes ""Y"" being a vowel? What a world."
1451,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Well, we just wanted to show you the new posters for the show."
1452,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Yeah, all right. Cool."
1453,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,So it's okay to hang these all over the city?
1454,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Yeah, it's good. I like it."
1455,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Really?
1456,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Really.
1457,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,I'll be leaving early today.
1458,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,PA,"Jenna and Ghostface Killah to the stage, please, for ""Muffin Top."""
1459,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Hello?
1460,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Jack? It's 3:00 in the morning. What's wrong?
1461,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,That's quite a commitment to such terrible writing.
1462,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Lemon, I don't know how to do this."
1463,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,I know.
1464,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,I don't get it. It's not the fear. I thrive on fear.
1465,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"You're looking out a fake window right now, by the way."
1466,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,I bow-hunt polar bear. I once drove a rental car into the Hudson just to practice escaping.
1467,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,And it's not the public speaking. There's just something about performing that I can't wrap my brain around.
1468,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"All this creative crap, acting. I've never been able to do it. Never."
1469,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Young Jack,Grains and cereals are an important... Line? Damn it. Son of a bitch.
1470,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Lemon, I need your help."
1471,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Really? Jack Donaghy needs my...
1472,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Don't gloat. It makes you seem mannish.
1473,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Okay, look, this is not your fault. This whole thing was a bad idea."
1474,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,We should just have Josh do it. We'll tell everyone you're on a business trip.
1475,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,That's not an option. I have to do it.
1476,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Once I set my mind to something, I have to accomplish it."
1477,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"10 years ago, I was an inch and a half shorter than I am today... sheer willpower."
1478,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"If I don't figure this thing out by Friday, then failure wins, and that's not acceptable."
1479,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Oh, God, the room is spinning."
1480,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,What do you want from me?
1481,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,I'm one of your actors. I'm freaking out. Talk me down.
1482,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Okay, here's your pep talk. You're not an actor. You're Jack Donaghy, all right, so quit whining and nut up."
1483,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"You're right. If you can't do this, you are a failure. Josh can do this, and, earlier today, he ate a club sandwich with the toothpick still in it."
1484,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Jenna can do this, and she was once engaged to David Blaine."
1485,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Any dum-dum can act, Jack, so be a man and get it done."
1486,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"If you were any other woman on Earth, I would be turned on right now."
1487,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Go home. Get some sleep.
1488,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"This stays between us, right, Lemon? Lemon? Lemon? Lemon?"
1489,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Well, I don't think I have to worry about my job anymore, and I didn't bother Jack at all."
1490,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, good for you."
1491,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,That's right. I took your advice. I hooked up with his boss.
1492,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Who? Ron? Mm-hmm. That guy's an extra on the show.
1493,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"No, he said he was Jack's boss."
1494,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,In the sketch. He doesn't even have a line.
1495,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,He doesn't have lines?
1496,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Page,Don't eat in costume.
1497,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,"Give me a break, I'm just..."
1498,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,But he was yelling at Jack.
1499,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,Actions speak louder than words. Take care of it.
1500,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Don't worry, sir, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning."
1501,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,I am tired of your promises.
1502,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"I just want this thing fixed now! I'm on it, sir."
1503,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,"What is the point of belonging to the Extras Guild if I cannot get health coverage for my foot, hmm?"
1504,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Ew.
1505,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, God, Jenna. I told you, don't listen to rumors."
1506,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,But Frank and Toofer said to me...
1507,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Frank and Toofer? That's where you're getting your information? They're messing with you.
1508,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"No, they wouldn't do that to me."
1509,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Yeah, they would."
1510,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,,Oh. I am gonna get back at them... using my sexuality.
1511,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Do you have any left?
1512,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,PA,"Jenna, Ghostface Killah, and Yo-Yo Ma to the stage, please, for ""Muffin Top."""
1513,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Where the hot lesbians at, Lemon?"
1514,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,I knew it. You can read.
1515,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,Fine. Yes. I'm literate.
1516,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"I even have a column in Ebony called ""Musings."""
1517,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,You're unbelievable.
1518,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,I'm unbelievable? What about your racist mess? Thinking a grown man is illiterate.
1519,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,That's the subtle racism of lowered expectations. Bing Crosby said that.
1520,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"No, Bill Cosby said that."
1521,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,That's racist.
1522,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Look, we can all agree, Liz is generally pretty racist."
1523,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"The point is, you have people counting on you. You can't be finding excuses not to be here."
1524,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,But this job is hard. I just want to be able to do what I want to do.
1525,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"You know, I once shot a whole movie without ever getting out of my car."
1526,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Yeah, I paid to see that. That was supposed to be a Western."
1527,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"You're not a big-shot movie star anymore, Tray. You're the star of ""TGS,"" and you will read the lines as written, starting tonight, because this show is important."
1528,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"I set a very high standard for myself, and I expect the same of the professionals who work with me."
1529,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Josh,"When Gaybraham Lincoln gets hit in the crotch, can I go cross-eyed?"
1530,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, yes, do that. That's hilarious."
1531,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Hey, have you seen Frank or Toofer?"
1532,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Pete... the Standards lady is saying my moaning in ""Muffin Top"" is too graphic."
1533,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Which of these is less offensive? Aah! Aah! Aah! Or... Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
1534,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ron,Both sound good to me.
1535,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"Hello, Ron."
1536,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"I just would hate for ""Muffin Top"" to get cut because of a Standards problem. I've already posted on my Weblog that I'll be doing it."
1537,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Jenna, we're not gonna cut it."
1538,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Are you messing with me? Because people keep messing with me.
1539,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,I'm not messing with you.
1540,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"So which one? ""Aah!"" or ""Ohh!""?"
1541,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,"Uh... I guess, uh... ""Aah! Aah! Aah!"""
1542,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, hey, look, it's no big deal, but we had to make some changes in your sketch. I have new pages for you."
1543,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,You do?
1544,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Yeah, Tracy is in it now, so we had to change some of the cues. Also, the opening V.T. is cut, so you just go right out, okay?"
1545,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Oh, and, um, you all say the last line together."
1546,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Wow, so, uh..."
1547,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,So you're gonna be great. Have fun.
1548,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Lemon, these pages are blank."
1549,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Oh, never mind. Withdrawn."
1550,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"And, remember, don't look into the camera."
1551,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,PA,"Cast should be setting themselves for the cold open. Cold open, everyone."
1552,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Toofer.
1553,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Toofer,Yeah?
1554,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Can I tell you a secret?
1555,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Toofer,Sure.
1556,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"We've been working together a while, and I know this may sound crazy, but I've been watching you. I have this fantasy of sneaking up to the roof of 30 Rock, and we make love while looking out at the city."
1557,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Toofer,"Okay, let me guess. You figured out Frank and I lied to you, so to get even, you're trying to get me naked on the roof and leave me there. Nice try."
1558,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Where's Frank?
1559,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Tracy,"Well, we're cool, right, Mr. Donaghy?"
1560,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"No, you're all fired."
1561,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"No, you're all fired."
1562,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"Hey, good job the other night."
1563,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Oh, you mean on the show. Thanks."
1564,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,What were you watching?
1565,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Nothing. Uh... Bloomberg.
1566,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,Aha!
1567,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,"Don't be cute, Lemon. You're too old for that."
1568,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Good God!
1569,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Lemon!
1570,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Frank,"Mr. Donaghy, open up. Please."
1571,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jack,Lemon!
1572,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,Everyone knows... the most delicious part of the muffin... is the top.
1573,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,"My muffin top is all that  Whole grain, low fat I know you want a piece of that But I just want to dance "
1574,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna, You're checking out my sweet hips My sugar-coated berry lips I know you want to get with this But I'm just here to dance 
1575,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,So back up off of me You're weirding me out 
1576,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Jenna,I'm an independent lady So do not try to play me I run a tidy baker The boys all want my cake for free 
1577,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,Does she know we went off the air two minutes ago?
1578,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Liz,"No, she does not."
1579,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Pete,Smart move.
1580,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ghostface Killa,You served up drama when I ordered your love. But I don't need this.
1581,1,5,Jack-Tor-Full,Ghostface Killa,Where the hell's my limo? Peace in the Middle East! We out!</p>
1582,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,It's so sweet of you to walk me to work today.
1583,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"You're my girl, right? I take care of you, huh?"
1584,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Who knows? Maybe we'll see Natalie Morales, you know? That little firecracker. She gets my blood running south of the border."
1585,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,That is less sweet.
1586,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"I'm gonna stop by tonight. Maybe I'll, uh, pick up some Chinese."
1587,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Aw. You said ""Chinese"" instead of something offensive."
1588,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"I told you, losing you last year changed me, huh? It made me more, um... more mature. Come here."
1589,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Ow. That really hurts! Dennis!
1590,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,You're back with Dennis?
1591,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Yeah. I'm back with Dennis. Don't look at me with your eyebrows all up. It's so annoying.
1592,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Oh, yes. I'm annoying. Not the man who honked your boobs on the jumbo screen."
1593,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"That was before, and it was the playoffs."
1594,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Does he still work at that beeper store? What is it, Beeper King?"
1595,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"He is the king now. The old Beeper King retired. Well, technically, he shot himself. But Dennis took over, and now he's the only beeper salesman left in Manhattan, which is cool."
1596,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,You're doing the eyebrow thing again.
1597,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,Because it's Dennis. Who are you trying to fool? This is me.
1598,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Exactly. You don't get to give dating advice. You sent a letter to Scott Peterson.
1599,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,After he dyed his hair and got super thin from all the stress. Are you kidding me? He was smokin'.
1600,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Dennis is a good guy, okay?"
1601,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Not really. So, when did this happen?"
1602,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Well, last week was my birthday. And everyone forgot except Dennis. He called, and we went out, and it wasn't too weird."
1603,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,And how was the sex?
1604,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Fast and only on Saturdays. It's perfect.
1605,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,Did you see this? It's horrible.
1606,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"They're printing libel about me again. Libel, Liz Lemon!"
1607,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Ugh! ""Normal."" How dare they?"
1608,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,That's what I'm saying. That's character assassination.
1609,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"That's not normal. It only looks like I'm walking out of a Starbucks, when actually I'm doing the robot going backwards into a Starbucks. And I don't even know whose dog that is."
1610,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"Yes, I steal dogs."
1611,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,What is the problem?
1612,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,,"I can't be normal. If I'm normal, I'm boring. If I'm boring, I'm not a movie star. If I'm not a movie star, then I'm poor. And poor people can't afford to pay back the $75,000 in cash they owe Quincy Jones."
1613,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Wow. Talking to that guy is like looking in a mirror, huh?"
1614,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Well, my armpit rash is back. Oh, my God, Jack. What are you doing in wardrobe?"
1615,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,The latest research is in. Our audience doesn't like green.
1616,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Oh, that's too bad. I like green."
1617,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Research doesn't lie, Jenna. It lets us know what we're thinking... what's too boring, what's too gay, what's too old."
1618,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,What's too old?
1619,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,That's a very good question. How old are you?.
1620,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,I'm 29
1621,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,What year were you born?.
1622,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,1977
1623,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,When did you graduate high school?.
1624,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,'94
1625,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,When do you turn 40?.
1626,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,2017
1627,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Junior high crush?.
1628,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,Kirk Cameron
1629,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Prom theme?.
1630,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"""Motownphilly,"" Boyz II Men"
1631,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,What movie did you lose your virginity at?
1632,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"""Arachnophobia."""
1633,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Theater or drive-in?
1634,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,What's a drive-in?
1635,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Of course. I don't know why I bothered to ask.
1636,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,I can tell just from your physical appearance that you're obviously... 29.
1637,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"So, these page numbers, when done correctly, should be sequential."
1638,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Cerie,"Oh. Oh, Josh, Liz Taylor's assistant called. They wanted the address here to send you something."
1639,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Josh,That's awesome! She must have seen my impression of her.
1640,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Frank,Sounds like someone loves Liz Taylor.
1641,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Josh,I do
1642,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Toofer,"No, we mean love love."
1643,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Frank,"Yeah, like if she walked in right now and said she wanted to do it with you, you would."
1644,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Josh,I definitely would.
1645,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Frank,What?
1646,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,Liz.
1647,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Josh,"I'm totally serious. I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
1648,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Uh, Jack asked me how old I am."
1649,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,What did you say?
1650,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,29.
1651,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Jenna, relax."
1652,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"I cannot and will not relax, Liz."
1653,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"I am an actress, and when someone asks an actress how old she is, it's more statement than question."
1654,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Cerie,"When my mom's feeling old, she goes to this guy on 71 st Street. But she's old. She's like 38."
1655,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,I'm gonna be sick.
1656,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Betcha he reads Betcha she sews Betcha they've made me a closet of clothes
1657,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,God.
1658,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Lemon, what tragedy happened in your life that you insist upon punishing yourself with all this... mediocrity?"
1659,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"What, 'cause I'm eating a turkey sub?"
1660,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Your turkey sub, your clothes, the fact that a woman of your resources and position lives like some boxcar hobo."
1661,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Or maybe it's the fact that while I'm saying all this, you have a piece of lettuce stuck in your hair."
1662,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"This is the unlisted number of Stone, the most exclusive restaurant in the city, currently."
1663,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,I think it's time that you start enjoying some of the finer things in life.
1664,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Completely unsolicited and inappropriate.
1665,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I will only accept it because I love food.
1666,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Do you know why Jack Welch is the greatest leader since the Pharaohs?
1667,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Because he didn't only involve himself in our work lives, but our personal lives as well."
1668,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"He introduced us to the finest booze, the most restrictive country clubs. He gave us the names of the most discrete private investigators to spy on our ex-wives. He held our hands during our triumphs and our Senate hearings."
1669,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"I want to hold your hand, Lemon."
1670,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Yikes.
1671,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,This is a perfect example. You have a million-dollar view. But you refuse to acknowledge that there's a whole world out there.
1672,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Oh, my. There appears to be a gentleman making passionate, anguine love to himself."
1673,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Yeah, I know. That's why I closed the blinds in the first place."
1674,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Right in his office. Huh.
1675,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Lemon, I like to think of myself as a winner, and I like to surround myself with winners. I see potential in you."
1676,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Let me be your Jack Welch. Let me be your mentor.
1677,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"No, thank you."
1678,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,That is unfortunate.
1679,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"You've, uh, got to admire his persistence and stamina, though. Am I wrong, or is he in the middle of a staff meeting?"
1680,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Maybe you should be his mentor.
1681,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Obviously, he doesn't need one. He's got it all figured out."
1682,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,I got one for you. See the old guy over there with the girl? Mistress or daughter?
1683,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Oh, my God. I hope it's his daughter."
1684,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,Yeah. Me too.
1685,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Oh, my God! I hope it's his mistress. Oh, that is just wrong."
1686,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Hey, 007, how about some more rolls over here, huh?"
1687,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Oh, my, my. What a pleasant surprise. Lemon. And you brought a man."
1688,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Jack Donaghy. And this is my friend Anastasia. How are you?
1689,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Hi. Dennis Duffy, Beeper King."
1690,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,The Beeper King. Really?
1691,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Uh, Dennis has his own business. Yes, he's an entrepreneur. He's very successful."
1692,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"You probably see my ads on the 7 train, right?"
1693,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,I didn't know they served chicken nuggets at this restaurant.
1694,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"It's cod. It's, uh... They made it special. Dennis has some dietary restrictions."
1695,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Actually, I'm allergic to all fish unless it's fried, you know?"
1696,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"That's a sharp tie you've got there, Dennis."
1697,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,That douche bag up front made me wear it.
1698,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Does he know you're the Beeper King?
1699,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,I don't think so.
1700,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Anyway, thanks for the hookup. This is clearly the nicest restaurant we've ever been to."
1701,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Oh, hold on a second. This place ain't that nice, all right? It's got rats and roaches like every other restaurant."
1702,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"No rat talk tonight, okay?"
1703,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,Do you know there are 17 rats per person in Manhattan? You eat a pound of rat crap every year without even knowing it.
1704,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,I think I read about that in The New Yorker.
1705,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Anyway, we'll leave you to your meal. I hope you enjoy the, uh, choices that you've made."
1706,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Stop it.
1707,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Kenneth,And that former call girl went on to become one of NBC's biggest news anchors.
1708,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Kenneth,"Star coming. Wall hug, everybody."
1709,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Lady,"That's Tracy Jordan! He seems like such a nice, normal young man."
1710,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,Aah!
1711,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Kenneth,"Let's keep going, you guys. Let's keep going."
1712,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I enjoyed the restaurant. Thank you.
1713,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Just say it. Just say what you're dying to say.
1714,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Dennis is nice to me, okay? He fixed my toilet. He broke it first, but he fixed it."
1715,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"And he loves hockey, and I'm... figuring it out."
1716,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"And it's easy. I get a lot of work done. I don't have time for a personal life, okay?"
1717,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I can't just go to Central Park and join the singles' touch-football league.
1718,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Like I'd want to, anyway. People on those posters always laughing in their sweaters. God, who are they fooling?"
1719,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Oh, okay, you're not gonna say anything to me because I rejected you as a mentor?"
1720,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Who cares? I have a lot of friends I can talk to about my life.
1721,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"The bottom line is, Dennis is my boyfriend because he inquired. He was the only applicant. And I am not... ...doing great."
1722,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,Come in.
1723,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Hey, do you have a minute? I need to talk to you about... Aah! What did you do to yourself?"
1724,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Me? Oh, nothing. Just getting more rest. Drinking more water."
1725,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Really? This water... does someone boil it first and throw it in your face?
1726,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Okay, I had a little Botox and some collagen and a chemical peel and something with shark DNA. Admit it. I look 10 years younger."
1727,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"No, younger even. You look like a fetus."
1728,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I came here to talk to you about my problems with Dennis.
1729,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,"Oh, I can't right now, honey. If I don't do my facial exercises, I could wind up looking weird."
1730,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"I just mentioned Dennis, and your eyebrows didn't go up."
1731,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,They didn't?
1732,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,No.
1733,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,How about now?
1734,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Unh-unh.
1735,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,Anything?
1736,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Hey, what's up, baby? Liz around?"
1737,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Cerie,She should be back soon. Is that a present for her?
1738,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Yeah. If she doesn't get back soon, I'm poking air holes in it."
1739,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice that, uh, none of you are wearing beepers."
1740,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Frank,You sell beepers?
1741,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"I sell a way of life, my friend."
1742,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Frank,Cool. I could use some ironic accessories.
1743,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,What are you doing here?
1744,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,Hey. I brought you a present.
1745,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Uh-oh. Oh, no. It got out. If anyone sees a salamander, it's Liz's, okay?"
1746,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,No. I don't want a salamander. And I don't want you here selling beepers.
1747,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Why not? I mean, you work in a business. Businesspeople need beepers."
1748,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"No, they need cellphones."
1749,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Oh, yeah, for now. But the beeper's gonna be making a comeback. Technology's cyclical."
1750,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"No, technology is not cyclical."
1751,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"I thought I recognized that voice. Dennis, how the heck are you? Did you enjoy that restaurant?"
1752,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,No. I think I was right about that place. We saw a whole nest of rats when we were leaving.
1753,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"No, we didn't."
1754,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Yeah, I did. I didn't want to tell you 'cause I knew you'd freak out."
1755,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Actually, I think I saw a rat king."
1756,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Frank,Aren't rat kings a myth?
1757,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Cerie,What's a rat king?
1758,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Frank,"Oh, it's when a bunch of rats are crammed into a tiny space, and their tails get all tangled up, and they can't even pull apart."
1759,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"And then it gets awesome. Eventually their bodies fuse together, and they form a multiheaded live rat king, and we saw one."
1760,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,I hope you got a picture of that with the camera on your beeper.
1761,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,"Actually, my beeper doesn't have a camera. But it does have a pedometer. Actually, not this one."
1762,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Listen, I need to talk to you in my office, please."
1763,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,Why? Now.
1764,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Now.
1765,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,What's up?
1766,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Is that a tattoo?
1767,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"Uh-huh. Who normal now? You hear me, America? Who's normal now?"
1768,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,How could you do this to the show?
1769,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"I got this tattoo for the good of the show. It gives us an edge... the reason why you brought me on. And when you purchase Tracy Jordan, he comes with a tattoo of a biblical dragon from outer space."
1770,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,It's gonna take forever to cover this with makeup.
1771,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"You can't put makeup on my tattoo, Liz Lemon. It's in my contract."
1772,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"No, it's not."
1773,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,"Actually, he's got a pretty weird contract."
1774,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Great... Jenna looks like a porn-star burn victim, and now this idiot. What are we gonna do?"
1775,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,It's gonna be Josh's busiest show ever.
1776,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz Taylor,Josh.
1777,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Josh,Ms. Taylor.
1778,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Josh,"When your office said you were sending me something, I didn't realize it would be you."
1779,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz Taylor,"But I had to give you this gift... in person, Josh."
1780,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Josh,Oh. I'm just glad you weren't offended by my impression.
1781,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz Taylor,Oh. But I was. Deeply.
1782,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz Taylor,I'm here to give you the gift of pain.
1783,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Josh,The gift of what?
1784,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz Taylor,White Diamonds! Aah!
1785,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Okay. Very funny. You bought a pager from Dennis. Will you take it off now, please?"
1786,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Oh, I can't. I'm expecting a call from 1983."
1787,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Look, Dennis takes care of me, okay?"
1788,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Liz, I'd like you to meet Howard Jorgensen."
1789,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jorgensen,"Liz, how do you do?"
1790,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,He's the vice president of locomotives and a rising star at G. E. I thought the two of you had a lot in common.
1791,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,You are relentless.
1792,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Look, Howard, you're obviously an attractive and confident guy. And at a different time in my life, I could definitely see the two of us together."
1793,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jorgensen,I'm married with two beautiful kids and a pool.
1794,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Liz, I wasn't trying to set you up. I wanted to show you my handiwork. I used to mentor Howard."
1795,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jorgensen,"I was a lot like you. I dressed poorly, had bad posture, walked around with lettuce in my hair."
1796,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Oh, son of a bitch."
1797,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jorgensen,And I cursed like a sailor. But Jack saw potential in me. He changed my life.
1798,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Now Howard's earning seven figures, and he's married to a swell Filipino gal."
1799,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jorgensen,"Thanks, Jack."
1800,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Look, I told you, I don't need a mentor."
1801,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Fine.
1802,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,Liz Taylor really messed him up. He might have brain damage.
1803,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Oh, my God. Maybe the musical guest can do some extra songs this week. Who is it?"
1804,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,James Blunt.
1805,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Mm.
1806,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,No. I said no lettuce.
1807,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,Are you at that crappy sandwich place again?
1808,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Yeah, why is everybody judging all of my choices lately?"
1809,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,This place is fine. It's convenient. It's consistent. I know what I'm getting. It doesn't make me feel bad about my body. Maybe I'm at an age where it's okay for me to settle for this.
1810,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,Are we still talking about the sandwich place?
1811,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"No. Sadly, I don't think we are."
1812,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Okay. I admit it. Dennis isn't a sandwich I want to eat every day for the rest of my life.
1813,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"I'm clueless about men. I'm clueless about everything that isn't this show. Maybe you can tell me how to live, because, sadly, you may be the most stable person I know right now."
1814,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Gentlemen, we'll have to continue this conference some other time."
1815,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jorgensen,"That's her again, isn't it?"
1816,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Hi, Howard."
1817,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Lemon, today is the first day of the rest of your life. And what is the first thing you need to do?"
1818,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I have to break up with Dennis.
1819,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,And why is that?
1820,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Because he wears shirts with the Looney Tunes embroidered on them. Because he cuts his own hair. Because that one little nice thing that he does doesn't make up for the fact that I don't want to be seen with him in public.
1821,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,And if you don't break up with him now?
1822,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,He'll just keeping showing up at work to sell beepers. He'll just keep calling my mother to borrow money. We'll just get more and more tangled up in each other's lives until I just can't even get away and we're just like...
1823,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Oh, my God."
1824,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,That's right. He's the rat king. And there's only one way to break up with a rat. You have to cut him off completely.
1825,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I know.
1826,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,You have to stuff your heart with steel wool and tinfoil. You must be ruthless. You must be absolute.
1827,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Remember always, you are the exterminator. Say it."
1828,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I am the exterminator.
1829,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Say it like you mean it.
1830,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I am the exterminator.
1831,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Louder!
1832,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,I am the exterminator!
1833,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Okay. Not that loud. People are trying to work around here, okay? Okay."
1834,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,PA,"30 minutes to dress rehearsal, everybody."
1835,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Tracy, they need you in wardrobe."
1836,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,PA,That's 30 minutes to dress.
1837,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Why is part of your face still on the pillow?
1838,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,Damn it. Where's my Sharpie?
1839,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Oh, it is fake."
1840,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"Look, I'm crazy, not stupid. A movie star can't have a big old permanent face tattoo."
1841,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"I just need to walk around with this for a week, get my picture on the interweb, show the world I'm still dangerous!"
1842,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"What about next week, when you don't have it anymore? You're gonna look like..."
1843,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"I had extreme plastic surgery to have it removed. Baboom! There's another ""not normal."""
1844,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"You know this is very, very, very bad for me, right?"
1845,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"I need to protect my reputation. You take away my street cred, and I am Wayne Brady."
1846,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Nuh-uh. Wayne Brady has three Emmys. You have a People's Choice Award that you stole from Wayne Brady.
1847,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,I shouldn't expect a white woman from Whiteville to understand street cred.
1848,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"First of all, I'm not from Whiteville. I'm from White Haven. And it's not as nice as it sounds."
1849,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Fine. You can keep the tattoo. For this week only!
1850,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Man,Okay. Here we go.
1851,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Director,"Quiet, please!"
1852,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Man,Rehearsing.
1853,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Voice Over,And now a word from the White House.
1854,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jenna,Good evening. I'm Laura Bush.
1855,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,And I'm Condoleezza Rice.
1856,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,"Well, we had a good run."
1857,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,What the hell happened here?
1858,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,The cast had a rough week.
1859,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,These people cannot be on television. What is your contingency plan for a crap storm of this magnitude?
1860,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,There is none.
1861,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,We go live in a half an hour.
1862,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,No wonder your career is being held back by a lack of foresight and an addiction to dysfunctional relationships. You have no exit strategies.
1863,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,He knows about my marriage.
1864,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,No. This is gonna be a bad show.
1865,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,Worse than the time we let Tracy do that tribute to August Wilson?
1866,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,That was my fault. I should have made sure he knew who August Wilson was
1867,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,Maybe we'll be preempted by some national news event. How's Gerald Ford's health?
1868,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Oh! A blackout. That will work.
1869,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,"All right, nobody panic. The backup generator will kick in in just a few seconds."
1870,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Pete,Okay. You can panic.
1871,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,This is real.
1872,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"We dodged a bullet here tonight, Lemon."
1873,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Yes, this blackout is a fortunate coincidence. You didn't do it, right?"
1874,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"What, you think I control the universe?"
1875,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"Yo! This blackout messed me up. I didn't get to debut my dragon face. Can I do ""The Today Show"" tomorrow?"
1876,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"No, you're on a plane to Boston tomorrow, Tray."
1877,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,We have a laboratory. They're experimenting in tattoo removal. It promises to be one of our biggest profit centers once today's generation finally sobers up.
1878,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Tracy,"Tattoo's fake, Donaghy. Fake."
1879,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Street cred. He's a genius.
1880,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Man,"Flashlight, $20. Flashlight, $20."
1881,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,Can I give you a ride?.
1882,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Man,"Flashlight, $20."
1883,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,No. I wouldn't want to crowd you.
1884,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Be strong, Lemon. Don't let Dennis chew his way out of this one."
1885,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Man,"Flashlight, $20."
1886,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Can I borrow 20 bucks?
1887,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Man,"Flashlight, $20."
1888,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,"Dennis, wake up. God."
1889,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,Huh? What?
1890,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,You're gonna burn the place down.
1891,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,I wish I had burned the place down. There's no reason to live anymore.
1892,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,What happened?
1893,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,The Islanders lost tonight.
1894,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,Doesn't that happen a lot?
1895,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Dennis,I knew you wouldn't understand.
1896,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"So, how did it go?"
1897,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Liz,He moved in with me.
1898,1,6,Jack Meets Dennis,Jack,"Well, of course he did."
1899,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Hello? Excuse me? There's a line, buddy."
1900,1,1,Pilot,Man,There's two lines.
1901,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"No, no, there's one line. We're in it."
1902,1,1,Pilot,Man,I'm just getting a hot dog.
1903,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"We're all getting hot dogs. What, do you think there's two lines and we're all in this line and you're the only genius that got in the other line? You believe this guy?"
1904,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Don't line up behind him. He cheated you.
1905,1,1,Pilot,Man,"Hey, shut up."
1906,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Now I want all the hot dogs, please. Yeah, I'm buying all the hot dogs."
1907,1,1,Pilot,Man,"You don't have to do that. No, no, no, You don't have to do that. That is ridiculous."
1908,1,1,Pilot,Liz,And I'm giving them to the good people.
1909,1,1,Pilot,Man,I'm starving.
1910,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,That's me
1911,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,This fat suit smells like corn chips.
1912,1,1,Pilot,PA,"Going again,please. Thank you."
1913,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"And this is the set of ""The Girlie Show."" It's a real fun ladies' comedy show for ladies."
1914,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"Hey, everybody, look. Here's someone you never get a chance to meet. It's the head writer of ""The Girlie Show,"" Liz Lemon."
1915,1,1,Pilot,Cerie,"""The Girlie Show."" Hold on, I'll connect you."
1916,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Hey.
1917,1,1,Pilot,Pete,What's up?
1918,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Hey, have you looked at that cat-lady sketch? It's still seven minutes long."
1919,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Yikes, okay."
1920,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
1921,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Why?
1922,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Apparently, you can't say he's got a vagina."
1923,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Ohh! Fine, I'll just take the whole thing out."
1924,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Hey, you've got to tell that NBC pageto take it down a notch."
1925,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Who, Kenneth?"
1926,1,1,Pilot,Liz,He just embarrassed mein front of a whole tour group.
1927,1,1,Pilot,Pete,I'll talk to him. What is this?
1928,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Well, you know how I hate it when people cheator break rules?"
1929,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Yes, I do."
1930,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners."
1931,1,1,Pilot,Pete,Attaboy.
1932,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,"Chumley, the beverage situation around here is reprehensible."
1933,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Oh, good morning, sunshine."
1934,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,"Surely, our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee."
1935,1,1,Pilot,Frank,"Yeah, or, like, a big coffee dispenser."
1936,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,That's what a samovar is.
1937,1,1,Pilot,Frank,"Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?"
1938,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Uh, Cerie, do you want to go get some coffee?"
1939,1,1,Pilot,Cerie,"No, thank you. "
1940,1,1,Pilot,Liz,No? 
1941,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Hey, Josh, I need to change your Michael Jackson thing. Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression?"
1942,1,1,Pilot,Josh,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out. So, President Bush is in the news again. "
1943,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"No, Jay Leno."
1944,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,"The host of ""The Tonight Show."""
1945,1,1,Pilot,Josh,"That's what I was doing. So, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars, you know?"
1946,1,1,Pilot,Frank,"No, no, like Jay Leno."
1947,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines."""
1948,1,1,Pilot,Frank,Have you ever noticed when you eat a lot of cheese...
1949,1,1,Pilot,Josh,How is that different from what I was doing?
1950,1,1,Pilot,Pete,And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
1951,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"I agree.I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
1952,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
1953,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
1954,1,1,Pilot,Pete,I'm sure you will.
1955,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,I just... I just love television so much.
1956,1,1,Pilot,Pete,We all do.
1957,1,1,Pilot,Cerie,"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
1958,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Who, Gary? All right, tell him I'll be up in half an hour."
1959,1,1,Pilot,Cerie,"No, they said now."
1960,1,1,Pilot,Frank,"If they've got cookies up there, grab some."
1961,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,"Ooh, and get them to pay for my samovar."
1962,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Of course. I assume that's what we're meeting about.
1963,1,1,Pilot,Frank,What about Ray Romano? Can you do Ray?
1964,1,1,Pilot,Josh,"Hey, aah, ho, Debra."
1965,1,1,Pilot,Frank,There you go.
1966,1,1,Pilot,Josh,My brother's tall! Right?
1967,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Are we in trouble or something?
1968,1,1,Pilot,Pete,No way. Gary loves the show. Pleased with the ratings.
1969,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Right, of course. They love us. Where's Gary?"
1970,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Gary's dead. I'm Jack Donaghy, new VP of Development for NBC-GE-Universal-Kmart."
1971,1,1,Pilot,Pete,We own Kmart now?
1972,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"No. So, why are you dressed like we do?"
1973,1,1,Pilot,Pete,I'm surprised you're renovating. This is such a nice office.
1974,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"It's a great office, but sometimes, you have to change things that are perfectly good just to make them your own."
1975,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Please. Uh, I'll call her back.Is she at the White House line? Great."
1976,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Tell them I need a 4:00 A. M. tee-off time.
1977,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Uh, 5 inches, but it's thick."
1978,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Are you familiar with the GE trivection oven?
1979,1,1,Pilot,Liz,I don't cook very much.
1980,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Sure. I got you. New York third-wave feminist, college-educated, single and pretending to be happy about it, over scheduled, undersexed. You buy any magazine that says ""healthy body image"" on the cover. And every two years,you take up knitting for...a week."
1981,1,1,Pilot,Pete,That is dead-on!
1982,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"What, are you gonna guess my weight now?"
1983,1,1,Pilot,Jack,You don't want me to do that.
1984,1,1,Pilot,Pete,That knitting thing is uncanny. How do you do that?
1985,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Market research, my friend. Years and years of market research which led to my greatest triumph... the trivection oven."
1986,1,1,Pilot,Pete,Oh. My wife wants one of those.
1987,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Can we get Pete an oven, please?"
1988,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"The GE trivection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional oven because it uses three kinds of heat...thermal technology for consistent temperature, GE precise air-convection technology for optimal air circulation, and microwave technology for incredible speed."
1989,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey...in 22 minutes."
1990,1,1,Pilot,Pete,Wow.That is impressive.
1991,1,1,Pilot,Jack,The people upstairs think so. That's why they promoted me. That's why they sent me here to retool your show.
1992,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Retool what, now?"
1993,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I'm the new Vice President of east-coast television and microwave-oven programming.
1994,1,1,Pilot,Liz,That sounds like you program microwave ovens.
1995,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I like you. You have the boldness of a much-younger woman.
1996,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Lee, does my face look bloated to you?"
1997,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"When I played that lady rapist on ""Law & Order,"" guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out. Hemorrhoid cream."
1998,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"Miss Maroney, I have the cat wrangler here for you."
1999,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Oh, is it that horrible little... Hi."
2000,1,1,Pilot,Greta,Hey. Greta Johanssen... short for Lugreta.
2001,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,Hi. Great to see you again.
2002,1,1,Pilot,Greta,You too. I'm here to introduce you to the feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
2003,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,Okay.
2004,1,1,Pilot,Greta,This is Poppo. And this here is Captain Boots.
2005,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,Hello.
2006,1,1,Pilot,Greta,Would you describe yourself as cat-competent?
2007,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Oh, yes.I love cats. I used to have two cats. But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors,so we had to put them down. I'm joking."
2008,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"We've done several focus groups on the show, and what I've gleaned...the blond, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays."
2009,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Jenna. That's my friend Jenna.
2010,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49."
2011,1,1,Pilot,Liz,I'm not missing them. They're just not there.
2012,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I think I can fix that.
2013,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"So, your job is you take things that are already working, and you fix them. That's a great job."
2014,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Why don't we, uh..."
2015,1,1,Pilot,Jack,You're missing that third kind of heat. I want you to think about Tracy Jordan.
2016,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Okay, the black guy?"
2017,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"The black movie star. I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining."
2018,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Isn't he, um... crazy?"
2019,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Tracy's had his problems in the last few years.
2020,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,I am a Jedi! I am a Jedi! I am a Jedi!
2021,1,1,Pilot,Jack,The important thing to remember is he was never charged with a crime. It's not illegal to fall asleepon your neighbor's roof.
2022,1,1,Pilot,Pete,Nor should it be.
2023,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Tracy Jordan is the third heat.
2024,1,1,Pilot,Pete,I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.
2025,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I think I do. What are you doing?
2026,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Sometimes, when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it."
2027,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"""This is not a dream."" Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz.I'd like you to have lunch with him."
2028,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"We have a show tonight, Mr. Donaghy. I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal and then a live show."
2029,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"That's tonight. This is lunch. If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing."
2030,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"If I meet with Tracy Jordan and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off?"
2031,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"I'm known for being reasonable. Okay.Alfredo, 2:00 PM."
2032,1,1,Pilot,Liz,I'm not dressed for that.
2033,1,1,Pilot,Jack,You're dressed for Burger King. Should we make it Burger King?
2034,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Pete, hang back for me."
2035,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Yeah, you bet."
2036,1,1,Pilot,PA,"Y'all, please set yourselves for ""Dr. Ridiculous."""
2037,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,Hey. What happened to your head?
2038,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"The sky is falling. Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow? Thank you, Lee."
2039,1,1,Pilot,Lee,Whatever.
2040,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Hey, you know in that cat-lady sketch, do I have to hold a real cat?"
2041,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Cat-lady sketch? That thing's gonna get cut.
2042,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Oh, good. Who's that?"
2043,1,1,Pilot,Liz,That is the new network dude.
2044,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Mmm, yummers. He reminds me of Scotty on ""General Hospital."""
2045,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"No, ew, Jenna, do not like that man. That is a bad man. God, you have a gift."
2046,1,1,Pilot,Lee,Laura Bush is your size.
2047,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Excuse me. Hi. What are you doing down here?
2048,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I'm known for being hands-on.
2049,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Clearly.
2050,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
2051,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
2052,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Now, Afghanistan is a different situation."
2053,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,I'll have an apple juice.
2054,1,1,Pilot,Waiter,"We don't have apple juice, sir."
2055,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
2056,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
2057,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,I know who you are.
2058,1,1,Pilot,Liz,I thought there was a strict dress code at this place.
2059,1,1,Pilot,Waiter,I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli. They're very subtle.
2060,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show, and I don't know how you feel about that..."
2061,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Let me ask you a question, everybody at this table. Did he just say the word ""pumpkin"" to me?"
2062,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli."
2063,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,Yo !I'm buggin'. I can't do this. I cannot eat here. I can't eat here. I got to go someplace where they make food that I like.
2064,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Lemon, let's go."
2065,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,I will not work with Tracy Jordan.
2066,1,1,Pilot,Frank,It's just a rumor.
2067,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,Have you seen any of his movies? The guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
2068,1,1,Pilot,Cerie,"I saw the one where he plays, like,five different characters."
2069,1,1,Pilot,Josh,"Yeah, ""Black Cop, White Cop."""
2070,1,1,Pilot,Cerie,No.
2071,1,1,Pilot,Josh,"""Who Dat Ninja""?"
2072,1,1,Pilot,Cerie,"No, he... he had to pretend to be this old lady."
2073,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Ooh, ooh, goodness gracious! You hooligans better watch out! 'Cause this honky grandma be trippin'!"
2074,1,1,Pilot,Frank,"Oh, yeah, that movie was hilarious. I saw it, like, five times."
2075,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Where's the love? Right on. Hey, let me get two half a chickens and some pecan waffles."
2076,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Nothing for me. I had, like, four hot dogs this morning."
2077,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Eat, Lemon, eat. I hate skinny women."
2078,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Hey, Lana, 10 beers."
2079,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"So, Tracy, we should talk about the show."
2080,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way. You know, I want it to be raw, HBO-style content."
2081,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Well, it's not HBO. It's TV. And I don't think that it's a good fit."
2082,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,'Cause I'm gonna drop truth bombs.
2083,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,You know how pissed off I was when US Weekly said that I was on crack? That's racist. I'm not on crack. I'm straight-up mentally ill.
2084,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Sure.
2085,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,I got mental-health issues.
2086,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Sure. Well, you know, who doesn't, really?"
2087,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Hey, has anyone seen Liz? Or Pete?"
2088,1,1,Pilot,Frank, She went out.
2089,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
2090,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I'm in charge.
2091,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Oh. Okay. Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
2092,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I think it's hot.
2093,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Thank you. I'm Jenna, by the way."
2094,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"Miss Maroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
2095,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,It's for my face.
2096,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
2097,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"You know,I don't think you'd like it, 'cause we work a lot of hours and it's live TV, which is risky."
2098,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like risky. See, me and you, we play the game. We know how to be acceptable. ""Hello, great meeting. I drink coffee, please."""
2099,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,This show is our chance to break the shackles. 'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
2100,1,1,Pilot,Liz,What white dudes?
2101,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"All of 'em. Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe."
2102,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Karl Robe, you say?"
2103,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other, to distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets. That's a metaphor."
2104,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Sure. You should tell that to US Weekly.
2105,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Hey, Lemon, you like karaoke? I know a joint."
2106,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"No, I've got to wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy."
2107,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,I'll take you. I'll take you. I just got to make a quick stop first.
2108,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"You know what? When people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or at the store. No, thank you."
2109,1,1,Pilot,Liz,You know what? This is for computer classes.
2110,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"You know why I should do this TV show, Lemon?"
2111,1,1,Pilot,Liz,I really don't.
2112,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"To get you rich. 'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gonna blow up."
2113,1,1,Pilot,Liz,How do you know I'm not rich?
2114,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,Your teeth.
2115,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"You got to think like these strippers, Lemon. They know the window of opportunity is only open for a moment. You got to get in while you're young, get the money, and get out."
2116,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy. I don't have sex for a living."
2117,1,1,Pilot,Stripper,Neither do we.
2118,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Neither do they. Yes, they do."
2119,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Where's my phone?
2120,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa,whoa, whoa, whoa  We are strong! No one can tell us we're wrong! Searching our hearts for so long!"
2121,1,1,Pilot,Liz,He's got charisma.
2122,1,1,Pilot,Stripper,"No, that's Charisma over there."
2123,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"""Girlie Show."""
2124,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Kenneth, send me a car, okay?"
2125,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,What is your location?
2126,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Dark Sensations in the Bronx.
2127,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,I wish you were here. Mr. Donaghy does not get us showbiz people.
2128,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Let me talk to Pete, okay?"
2129,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"Oh, Pete got fired this morning. That's so weird that you don't know that."
2130,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Jack Donaghy think she's gonna come into my house and mess with my show?! Hell no! Jenna and I worked for years to get this show. You know,I moved from Chicago for this."
2131,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,From Chicago? I was in Scottie Pippin's wedding.
2132,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us. He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
2133,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,Fire Pete? He can't fire Pete.
2134,1,1,Pilot,Liz,You know what? I quit. He can suck it.
2135,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, suck it, Pete."
2136,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"No, you're not listening. You're not a good listener."
2137,1,1,Pilot,PA,20 minutes to air.
2138,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,But Liz said we were cutting the cat-lady sketch. She said it stinks. Ouch.
2139,1,1,Pilot,Jack,This is why Liz is wrong. Animal humor is universal.
2140,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,I just don't think that I'm good in it. Do you think I'm good in it?
2141,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
2142,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,What? What do you mean? Who's everybody?
2143,1,1,Pilot,Jack,"The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye..."
2144,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"You mean this eye? Okay, this eye, it doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
2145,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
2146,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,What?! Where is Liz?! Liz!
2147,1,1,Pilot,PA,Four minutes to air. That's four minutes to air.
2148,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Is Liz back yet?
2149,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,No. Which cat do you want Jenna to carry?
2150,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I'm sorry?
2151,1,1,Pilot,Toofer,Which cat?
2152,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Oh. I want... that one.
2153,1,1,Pilot,PA,"Jack Donaghy to the forum, please. Jack Donaghy."
2154,1,1,Pilot,Greta,Peanut's not an actor. I just rescued her from a lab.
2155,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off. Where do you live?"
2156,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"The studio. I want you to drop me at the studio. I want to tell Donaghy to his face that I quit, and I want to do it in front of the whole crew so that they know he didn't fire me."
2157,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,I want to see that.
2158,1,1,Pilot,PA,"It's time for ""The Girlie Show"""
2159,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Oh, oh, pull over! Pull over here!"
2160,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
2161,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,Right here. This is where I grew up.
2162,1,1,Pilot,Liz,This is the Jordan family estate?
2163,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,Wasn't no Jordan family nothing. This is where I was in foster care.
2164,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Oh, sorry."
2165,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers. I'm so luckyI got out of here.
2166,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"It's not luck. I mean, you got out of here because you're very talented and people love you and...Are you peeing?"
2167,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Where's Donaghy? I want to talk to him right now.
2168,1,1,Pilot,Kenneth,"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera. Oh, I have Pete for you."
2169,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
2170,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"No, hey, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
2171,1,1,Pilot,Liz,I'm quitting. I'm quitting right now.
2172,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"No, no, no, no, no. You have the best job in New York. Don't quit over this. Don't buy all the hot dogs, okay?"
2173,1,1,Pilot,Liz,I don't want to do this without you.
2174,1,1,Pilot,Pete,"Hey, I thought we cut the cat-lady sketch."
2175,1,1,Pilot,Crew,We're two minutes short!
2176,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"So, let me introduce myself. My name is Lurlene Katz. And these are my cats."
2177,1,1,Pilot,Liz,She's using a real cat?
2178,1,1,Pilot,Jack,I cast that cat myself.
2179,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"Why, they are my... Aah! Ow! Oh! No, no, no, no, he's okay!"
2180,1,1,Pilot,Liz,I need you to talk for two minutes.
2181,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,About what?
2182,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Anything.
2183,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,All right.
2184,1,1,Pilot,Jenna,"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
2185,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Excuse me. Where's the manager? I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
2186,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Uh-oh. Look at shorty. This honky grandma be trippin'! What's up, America?! I'm coming into your house live! Let me hear you say, ""We love you, Tracy!"""
2187,1,1,Pilot,Crowd,"We love you, Tracy!"
2188,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,I am the third heat!
2189,1,1,Pilot,Jack,He's brilliant.
2190,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Are you drunk?
2191,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Yes.
2192,1,1,Pilot,Liz,Why did you fire Pete?
2193,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Why did you disappear all night? Is this some kind of a power play?
2194,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Yeah, yeah, it's not so fun being hands-on with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
2195,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Can we talk about this on Monday?
2196,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"No, I want Pete back.I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe. And I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room."
2197,1,1,Pilot,Jack,Fine. I thought you were gonna quit.
2198,1,1,Pilot,Liz,"Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me."
2199,1,1,Pilot,Jack,You weigh 127 pounds.
2200,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Yeah. Oh, yeah! Holla at your boy!"
2201,1,1,Pilot,Greta,"Hey, you will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer."
2202,1,1,Pilot,Tracy,"Good night, sleep tight. I can't wait to do this with you every week."
2203,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Robot, kick him in the knees. Bears have weak knees."
2204,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"He should vibrate, 'cause the robot's full of radiation."
2205,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Yeah, that's it."
2206,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Frank? How many bears did I say you could have?
2207,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,One.
2208,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,And how many do you see here?
2209,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Um, four?"
2210,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Save a little money for the rest of us, Frank."
2211,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"You can't spend a bunch of money on bear suits, that are only gonna be seen for like 25 seconds."
2212,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Liz, nobody's gonna believe that a killer robot, can get his ass kicked by one bear. It doesn't make any sense."
2213,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,You're trying to bring logic to the robot-bear sketch? You can't have four bears!
2214,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Well, how many can I keep?"
2215,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,One!
2216,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Sorry, guys. Sam, why don't you stay?"
2217,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Who did my sudoku puzzle? I have been looking forward to this puzzle all morning.
2218,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Hey, Liz, could you come up to my office, when you have a free moment?"
2219,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"I never have a free moment, Jack... never, ever."
2220,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Really punch him, like karate."
2221,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Are you familiar with the Japanese art of reiki?
2222,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,No.
2223,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,It is the laying on of hands in order to improve one's life.
2224,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Hmm. How does you life improve? Do the hands have money in them?
2225,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Human contact is important, Lemon."
2226,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"I can tell from your stress level, that you have not been touched in any way in quite some time... not caressed, not massaged, not even groped on the subway."
2227,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Where are you headed with this?
2228,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Your mood affects the quality of your work,, which, in turn, affects me."
2229,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"I would like to become a resource to you, for improving your personal life."
2230,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Do you agree that you need someone in your life, Lemon?"
2231,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"No, I have bigger things to worry about, than my personal life."
2232,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"I would think that a single woman's biggest worry, would be choking to death alone in her apartment."
2233,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,I have a friend in town I'd like to set you up with.
2234,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"No, thank you."
2235,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Thomas is very bright, has a wonderful sense of humor."
2236,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,I think it's a good match. Are you free on Thursday?
2237,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"No, Thursday is poker night,, and, by the way, it is completely inappropriate, for you to be questioning me about my private life, and then trying to set me up with someone, when you don't even know anything about me."
2238,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Poker night? Who plays?
2239,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Really, that's all you got out of that?"
2240,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"I enjoy poker. I'd be interested in seeing my new employees, under that kind of pressure."
2241,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"You're not gonna come to our crappy poker game, are you?"
2242,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"No, I'm not."
2243,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Good.
2244,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"I bluffed. Yes, I am coming."
2245,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,3 can't go here. 3 can't go here. Can't go here. It can go here.
2246,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Fine, I'll meet your friend."
2247,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"So, who is this Thomas guy?"
2248,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Oh, I don't know. He's one of Jack's friends."
2249,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Oh, my God, isn't Jack friends with Tom DeLay?"
2250,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Am I going on a date with Tom DeLay?
2251,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Oh, why did I say I would do this?"
2252,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"I haven't been on a date since Dennis and I broke up, and that was almost a year ago."
2253,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,It's gonna be a complete disaster.
2254,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"It's just one date. But if it is Tom DeLay and you do go home with him,, be prepared for it to get weird."
2255,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"Josh, you and me, Thursday night. I know this guy that runs an underground bird fight."
2256,1,3,Blind Date,Josh,"Oh, yeah. I can't do that. Thursday's poker night here."
2257,1,3,Blind Date,PA,"Guys, we just need to try the green-screen stuff, one more time."
2258,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,Poker night? I love poker!
2259,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"I used to play all kinds of poker with my aunts... Crazy 7, Albuquerque Freak-Out, One-Card Stud."
2260,1,3,Blind Date,Josh,"Yeah, I don't think those are real games."
2261,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,Whatever. Get ready to get took.
2262,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"No, Mom, I can't make it Friday. I got to work."
2263,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Hey, Frank?"
2264,1,3,Blind Date,Frank, Hold on.
2265,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Yeah? What do guys like?
2266,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Uh, porn."
2267,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"No, I mean, if you were gonna go on a date with a woman,, how would you want her to act?"
2268,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,Like she was in a porn.
2269,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Hey, Lemon... you're on for 8:00 for dinner at Café des Artistes."
2270,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Really? Wow.
2271,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,What? What are you gonna wear?
2272,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"This, probably. I don't have time to go home."
2273,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"No, that won't do."
2274,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"I want you to go out on your lunch hour, and find something... in a women's clothing store."
2275,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"Remind me what's better,, a pair of black aces or a pair of red aces."
2276,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"You guys, I'm leaving."
2277,1,3,Blind Date,Writers,Whoo-hoo!
2278,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"All right, all right."
2279,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Hey, look at you! You look like a fancy prostitute."
2280,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Okay, I got my chair. I got my beer. I got my lucky doughnut."
2281,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Oh, is there room for one more?"
2282,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Yeah, sure. Really?"
2283,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,That's fantastic.
2284,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Could we just, uh, this. Ah, yes, yes, yes."
2285,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"Donaghy, what up?"
2286,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"What up, Tra?"
2287,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"This round, Texas Doozy. Face cards are wild, 3 is a jinx, 5s are 2s."
2288,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Tra, do you mind if I deal this hand?"
2289,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,Be my guest. Show me love.
2290,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Ladies and gentlemen, the minimum bet in this game is $25."
2291,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Oh, Jack, we usually just play for quarters."
2292,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Well, then you best go home and put on your daddy's shoes, boy. This is a man's game."
2293,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,Okay. I call.
2294,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,And I'll see that with this thing.
2295,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,I call.
2296,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,Pair of jacks.
2297,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,Ace-high.
2298,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Three cowboys.
2299,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Oh, my God, my wedding ring. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
2300,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Now, you should all learn from Pete's mistake."
2301,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,My wife's gonna k*ll me!
2302,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"You see, in poker, as in business, the key to success, is to determine your opponent's strength, and, more importantly, his weaknesses."
2303,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Everyone has a tell... a weakness of character that manifests itself physically.
2304,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Like, when Lutz here has a good hand, he stops eating."
2305,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"When Frank is bluffing, he asks a series of inane questions, to hide his nervousness."
2306,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Oh, really, is that what you think? Is that what I do? Am I doing that right now?"
2307,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Yeah, I'm out."
2308,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"Okay, Rain Man, tell me what I got."
2309,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Well, you have two of your cards backwards, actually."
2310,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,I'm out.
2311,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Hi, Pinot Grigio, please."
2312,1,3,Blind Date,Waiter,Mm-hmm.
2313,1,3,Blind Date,Toofer,This is beyond the pale. Donaghy took me for $200.
2314,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Yeah, well, I bet my rent money,, and if I don't pay by the 10th, my mom's gonna throw me out."
2315,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,I'm all-in. Anybody else?
2316,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"Oh, I'll play with you, Mr. Donaghy."
2317,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Kenneth, how long you been sitting there?"
2318,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"I'm taking Pete's place, 'cause he's busy in the bathroom,, laying in his own sick."
2319,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Oh, my God. He can't read Kenneth. He's a blank slate."
2320,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Okay, what do you got?"
2321,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,I think I have what they refer to as a royal flush.
2322,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,Looks like I'm the big winner.
2323,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Thank you.
2324,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,Liz?
2325,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Hi, I'm Gretchen Thomas, Jack's friend."
2326,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Hey.
2327,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,Great to meet you. Hi.
2328,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Why would Jack just assume that we're lesbians?
2329,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,I am a lesbian.
2330,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Mmm, that's awesome."
2331,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Is this the first time, somebody's made that assumption about you?"
2332,1,3,Blind Date,Coach,"Lemon, don't let these girls give you a hard time, about who you are."
2333,1,3,Blind Date,Dentist,"You know, you need to brush your teeth more, young man."
2334,1,3,Blind Date,Elderly Woman,"Oh, my, what an adorable little lesbian."
2335,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,What? I don't know. Who remembers that kind of thing?
2336,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Oh, well, look, obviously, this is a miscommunication. I'm certainly not interested in chasing a straight girl."
2337,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Of course, yeah."
2338,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,I completely understand if you just want to go home.
2339,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"No, it's fine. I'll stay."
2340,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Jack is ridiculous.
2341,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Oh, I worked with Jack in plastics."
2342,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"He tends to approach everything the same way... locate the problem, isolate the problem,, set the problem up with a lesbian."
2343,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,That's a pretty good joke for somebody from plastics.
2344,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Well, I wasn't always in plastics. I used to work in water-process technologies, working mainly in primary metals."
2345,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Oh, so you have a comedy background?"
2346,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,How was your evening with Thomas?
2347,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"You mean Gretchen Thomas, the brilliant plastics engineer/lesbian?"
2348,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,What made you think I was gay?
2349,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Your shoes.
2350,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Well, I'm straight."
2351,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Those shoes are definitely bi-curious.
2352,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Regardless, I am straight... 100% completely straight."
2353,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Well, I'm sorry if I offended you."
2354,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"No, I'm not offended."
2355,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Good.
2356,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"What do you know about Kenneth, the page?"
2357,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,I don't know. He's a sweet kid.
2358,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Yes, and a surprisingly good poker player."
2359,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Did you know that his middle name is Ellen?
2360,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"No, that's weird."
2361,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"That his Myers-Briggs psychological testing, shows a rare combination, of extroverted, intuitive, and aggressive?"
2362,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Really?
2363,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,It's the same as mine.
2364,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,He could be trouble down the line.
2365,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Kenneth?
2366,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Kenneth Ellen.
2367,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"All right, then, you're not a lesbian... duly noted. I'll correct that on your file."
2368,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"It's too bad, though. Thomas thought you were great."
2369,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,She did?
2370,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Yes. She said she thought you looked like Jennifer Jason Leigh.
2371,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Really, she said that?"
2372,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Yes, I made her repeat it. I was sure she meant Jason Lee."
2373,1,3,Blind Date,PA,"Jenna, set yourself, please, for ""Dancing with the Deity."""
2374,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,Miss Lemon?
2375,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Yes?
2376,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"This is Pete's wedding ring. I won it last night, but I don't think I should keep it. Could you give it back to him for me?"
2377,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Yeah, okay."
2378,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Did you win this, too?"
2379,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,I did. I love how the light catches it like diamonds.
2380,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Kenneth, it is diamonds."
2381,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"Ah, hi, Mr. Donaghy. Can I help you with something?"
2382,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"You are a puzzle, Kenneth Ellen. And I'm going to solve you. Yes, I am."
2383,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,I can't believe you bet your wedding ring.
2384,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"I know. Weird thing is, I had money left."
2385,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Hey, um, what famous person would you say I look like?"
2386,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Uh, present-day Linda Ronstadt."
2387,1,3,Blind Date,Toofer,"No, Ruth Bader Ginsburg."
2388,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,Tootsie.
2389,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Oh, never mind."
2390,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"So, how was your date?"
2391,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,It wasn't a good match.
2392,1,3,Blind Date,Toofer,What happened? Did he notice your facial tic?
2393,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,No.
2394,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,Did you wear sandals? Did he see your toes?
2395,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,No.
2396,1,3,Blind Date,Lutz,"You blew it, didn't you?"
2397,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Good job, Liz. Way to go."
2398,1,3,Blind Date,Toofer,Another one bites the dust.
2399,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Aw, look at your little face."
2400,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,It was a lady!
2401,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,Are you serious? Oh!
2402,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Where is my Emmy?
2403,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,Hello?
2404,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Hi, Gretchen. It's Liz Lemon."
2405,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Oh, hi."
2406,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Look, this is gonna sound really weird, but, um, do you ever worry about choking to death alone, in your apartment?"
2407,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Oh, it's so weird you would say that. I think about it all the time."
2408,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"I mean, you'd die, and they wouldn't find you, until your neighbor's dog smelled you from the hallway."
2409,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Oh, yes, and they'd show a picture of you on ""NY1."""
2410,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,And it's not just choking.
2411,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Ever since I turned 30, every time I get in or out of the bathtub,, I think in my head, ""Careful, careful."""
2412,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Yes! Oh! Everything's the worst.
2413,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Do you want to get some dinner?
2414,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,Sure. I'll see you in 20 at Neptune.
2415,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Yeah, okay,"
2416,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Oh! Oh, oh, oh! I can't..."
2417,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,I did not die.
2418,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Man, this is amazing."
2419,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Oh, hey, Jack."
2420,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Welcome. Welcome, everybody."
2421,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"Damn, Jack, you went all-out. That's a giant shrimp."
2422,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Made out of shrimp and diving into a bowl of shrimp.
2423,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Please, enjoy, Tracy. Hey, Pete, good to see you."
2424,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,Jack.
2425,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Is Kenneth here?
2426,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,I... I will check.
2427,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,I've been playing for two hours. I'm tired of losing. I'm gonna let my boy Dot Com play a hand for me.
2428,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"So, hey, Dot Com, are we going to those three clubs tonight?"
2429,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,"You know, the doctor said I have four hearts in my body?"
2430,1,3,Blind Date,Josh,All right. Come on.
2431,1,3,Blind Date,Tracy,Damn it.
2432,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Hey, everybody, this is Gretchen."
2433,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Oh, hey."
2434,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Thomas.
2435,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,Jack.
2436,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,How's everybody up there in Pittsfield?
2437,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,We miss you.
2438,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,I love this woman.
2439,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Let's play some poker.
2440,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"I call. What have you got, Kenneth?"
2441,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,All clovers. I win.
2442,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Very clever boy, Kenneth,, but the curtain has been drawn back now,, and I know the real you."
2443,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,I think he's confusing me with someone else.
2444,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,"Liz, are you sure you're not gay? Because that chick is hot."
2445,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"We're just friends, like Oprah and Gayle. Why is that so hard for everybody to believe?"
2446,1,3,Blind Date,PEte,She's great. You should marry that girl.
2447,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Yeah, one problem... I'm not gay."
2448,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Oh, Lemon, in the 10 years that I've known you,, you've had some really terrible boyfriends."
2449,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,I have.
2450,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,There was the guy who was obsessed with Charlie Chaplin.
2451,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Neil.
2452,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,There was the guy who played Halo under the name Slut Banger.
2453,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Dennis.
2454,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"There was a tall, gangly, red-haired guy, who played guitar all the time."
2455,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Conan.
2456,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"You're more relaxed with Gretchen, than you were with any of those guys."
2457,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"So, what are you saying, Pete, I should just be a lesbian?"
2458,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Oh, I'm not saying it'll be easy. You know, get drunk first."
2459,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Why do guys think women can just flip a switch like that?
2460,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"What if I said to you, ""Go be with Frank now""?"
2461,1,3,Blind Date,Pete,"Ah, I would be honored. Frank is a very tender, beautiful man."
2462,1,3,Blind Date,Frank,He's awesome. You can't read his thoughts 'cause he doesn't have any.
2463,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,I raise you $200.
2464,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,And I see your $200 and raise you $300.
2465,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Will you,, little Kenneth Ellen Parcell from Stone Mountain, Georgia,, growing up in your mama's tract house,, dreaming of working on a TV show,, dreaming of making it all the way to the NBC?"
2466,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"You're scaring me, Mr. Donaghy."
2467,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"You've come a long way, haven't you, Kenneth Ellen, with your cheap loafers and your page jacket? But you'll always be a pig farmer's son, boy,, 'cause I smell fried bologna all over you."
2468,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,I'm all-in.
2469,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"I'm out of chips, Mr. Donaghy."
2470,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Hey, I got a fun idea. You put your page jacket on the table. And if you win, you can get it back. If you lose... you go on home. You go on home, little Kenneth Ellen... all the way to Stone Mountain."
2471,1,3,Blind Date,Crowd,Go for it!
2472,1,3,Blind Date,Lutz,He's bluffing!
2473,1,3,Blind Date,Crowd,Do it!
2474,1,3,Blind Date,Crowd,Test yourself.
2475,1,3,Blind Date,Crowd,Don't do it.
2476,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,I've got a pair of 2s.
2477,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"Well, let's just seeby-weeby here."
2478,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"I've got a 2, a 4,, a 9, a 6, and a king."
2479,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,That means I win.
2480,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Kenneth, why did you bet that terrible hand?"
2481,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"Why? Because I believe that life is for the living. I believe in taking risks, and biting off more than you can chew."
2482,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"And, also, people were yelling,, and I got confused about the rules."
2483,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,Kenneth? I wasn't really going to fire you. I just wanted to remind you that I could.
2484,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"I want you back here at 6:00 in the morning sharp, so you can sweep up these shrimp tails."
2485,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"Yes, sir, Mr. Donaghy."
2486,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"Uh, I'm gonna have my eye on you, Kenneth."
2487,1,3,Blind Date,Kenneth,"You will not be disappointed, sir."
2488,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Well, it was nice of you to let him keep his job."
2489,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"The Italians have a saying, Lemon."
2490,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer."", And although they've never won a war, or mass-produced a decent car, in this area, they are correct."
2491,1,3,Blind Date,Jack,"In five years, we'll all either be working for him... ...or be dead by his hand."
2492,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Hey, after IKEA tomorrow,, you want to go see Margaret Cho at the Beacon?"
2493,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Oh, boy, uh, Oprah?"
2494,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Yes, Gayle?"
2495,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,I think we need to take a break.
2496,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Because I wanted to submit us for ""The Amazing Race""? Because I was 80% joking about that."
2497,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"No, it's... You know, I said I'm not into chasing straight girls,, and I kind of think that's what's starting to happen here. So, unless you're ready to make a big life change,, I need to move on, find my Stedman."
2498,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"I thought I was Oprah in this metaphor. Also, you're gay, so that's a little confusing. You should say, like, ""my lady Stedman."""
2499,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"Okay, I'm going out on a limb here."
2500,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Okay, sorry, um, it's just, uh,, if I try to imagine us being together, I think, ""Yeah, okay, this could be fun."", You know, picking out furniture, and making flowerbeds out of old railroad ties."
2501,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"But the thing is,, if I'm gonna be with someone, it has to be a guy."
2502,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,You sound pretty sure about that.
2503,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,What can I say? I love a bald spot and a hairy back.
2504,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,You're alone there. I should go. I'll see you around.
2505,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Okay, wait, um, what if we made a pact? What if we say that in, like, 25 years,, if neither of us has someone,, we'll move in together and be roommates?"
2506,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"And even though I am not into the sex stuff,, if it helps you,, I would let you do stuff to me."
2507,1,3,Blind Date,Thomas,"I can't be around you anymore. Bye, Liz."
2508,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,That's funny. That's what the guys always say.
2509,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,Who's gonna go with me to cooking class next weekend?
2510,1,3,Blind Date,Man,"Well, if by ""cooking class"" you mean your bed, and by ""next weekend"" you mean tonight..."
2511,1,3,Blind Date,Liz,"Oh, shut up. I can see your wedding ring. Idiot."
2512,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Well, I don't know why they need you in the studio."
2513,1,9,The Baby Show,All,Surprise!
2514,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"Oh, my God. Is this for me?"
2515,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,I can't believe you made all this fuss over my birthday. It's so incredibly thoughtful. Let me give something back to you guys.
2516,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,I believe the children are our are future Teach them well and let them lead the way
2517,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,"Hey, guess what, everyone. I'm engaged."
2518,1,9,The Baby Show,All,Oh!
2519,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Engaged!
2520,1,9,The Baby Show,Frank,"Hey, this isn't gonna change the way you dress or eat lollipops, is it?"
2521,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,No.
2522,1,9,The Baby Show,Frank,"Oh, then congratulations."
2523,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,Thank you.
2524,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"This is for you, Cerie. I believe the children are our future Teach them well and let them lead the way Show them... All the beauty they possess in..."
2525,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Everyone, guess what! There's an antique-car show out in the plaza!"
2526,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"Okay, I..."
2527,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,How long is Jack gonna be?
2528,1,9,The Baby Show,Jonathan,He's still on the phone.
2529,1,9,The Baby Show,Jonathan,"Area code 407? Oh, no. When did this happen?"
2530,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,407? Is that bad?
2531,1,9,The Baby Show,Jonathan,It's fine. It is gonna be just fine.
2532,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Aah!
2533,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Jonathan! These cheap phones keep on shattering!
2534,1,9,The Baby Show,Jonathan,You can go in now.
2535,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,No.
2536,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Who let 407 through? Jonathan, we have drills for this!"
2537,1,9,The Baby Show,Jonathan,Liz distracted me.
2538,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"No, I didn't."
2539,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,What's going on? Business got you down?
2540,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Business doesn't get me down. Business gets me off.
2541,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Now, what is your urgent problem this time?"
2542,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Well, uh, the writers and I wanted to get ""TGS"" jackets. But the guy in accounting says we can't have the jackets, but ""Dateline"" has jackets."
2543,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Jackets? Is this what you're talking about now? Jackets?
2544,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Lemon, do you realize that your little show accounts for 3% of our revenue but takes up 90% of my time?"
2545,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Hello!
2546,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Now, would you do me a kindness, please, and handle your problems yourself and stop bothering me? Is that too much to ask?"
2547,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Absolutely. Forget it. I won't bother you about anything anymore.
2548,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Wow. He's a little bit of a stress eater, huh?"
2549,1,9,The Baby Show,Jonathan,He puts up with so much.
2550,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,All right.
2551,1,9,The Baby Show,PA,"Jenna to the stage, please, for ""Jazz Police."""
2552,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Liz, you should have seen this guy at the club last night."
2553,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Everybody at this party is a Jedi.
2554,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,We must get our freak on while our fruit is plentiful.
2555,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Oh, no."
2556,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, sounds like another great party I wasn't invited to."
2557,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Thank you for the funnest night of my life. Love you, man."
2558,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"I love you, too, J. Bird."
2559,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Yo, I don't like that dude."
2560,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,It's disrespectful when he imitates me. I want him fired.
2561,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Aw, come on. It's a goof."
2562,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"How would you like it if I did an impression of you, Liz Lemon?"
2563,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,Hi! I'm Liz Lemon! I like to wear man shirts. Watch me skateboard.
2564,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,I don't skateboard.
2565,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Hurts, doesn't it?"
2566,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,I'm not firing Josh.
2567,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,You always take his side.
2568,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Tracy, stop Tasering him."
2569,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"See, I need to be respected, Liz Lemon. But what do you know about respect?"
2570,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Please, Tracy, just let it go."
2571,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Well, if you won't do anything about it, I'll just go over your head to Donaghy."
2572,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,No. No. Do not do that. Don't bother him.
2573,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,All right. I'll talk to Josh.
2574,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Hey, Cerie, what are you doing?"
2575,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,"Oh, I let them do my makeup sometimes. They say it's fun for them."
2576,1,9,The Baby Show,Anna,She's like a Barbie.
2577,1,9,The Baby Show,Anna,"Oh, sorry. My babysitter got jury duty. I think I'm going to kill myself."
2578,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"So, Cerie, how long have you known this guy that you're marrying?"
2579,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,lt'll be two months in three weeks.
2580,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,"You would love him, Liz. He's so funny."
2581,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,He does this thing where he screams at limo drivers.
2582,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Yeah. It just kind of seems like you're rushing into it a little bit. I guess.
2583,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,But we both want to have babies while it's still cool.
2584,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,"I already have all the names picked out. If it's a girl, Bookcase. Or Sandstorm. Or maybe Hat. But that's more of a boy's name."
2585,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Yeah. I was gonna say.
2586,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"It's just you're so young, Cerie. There's no big hurry to have babies."
2587,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"I mean, there are other things in life, like having a career and working and having a job... and working."
2588,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,"You can have a career at any time. But you only have a really short period where you can be a young, hot mom."
2589,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,"If you wait too long, you could be like 50 at your kid's graduation."
2590,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"50 is not that old, Cerie."
2591,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,"Oh, I'm sorry. Are you 50 now?"
2592,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,Paul Newman or Robert Redford?
2593,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,I've told you a thousand times. Newman because I enjoy his salad dressings and lemonade.
2594,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,Me too.
2595,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"Okay. Uh, Brad Pitt or George Clooney?"
2596,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Do you think I'd be a good mother?
2597,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,What?
2598,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Something's kicking in, and the last few months, I've just started wondering if I'm ever gonna have a baby."
2599,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"I'm so many steps away from being able to do it, and I panic that maybe I waited too long."
2600,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"I mean, what if my junk goes bad?"
2601,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,What if Cerie is right?
2602,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,Wow. Red wine is not your drink.
2603,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"I'm sorry. I'm in my right mind. I just... It comes in waves, you know?"
2604,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"And, uh, I love my job, and I love my friends. And if I am meant to crank out a kid, then I have plenty of time."
2605,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"Uh, not really."
2606,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Jenna!
2607,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"No, Liz, I'm just saying, if this is something you really want, let's go for it."
2608,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"I'll help you. Oh, please, let me help you for once."
2609,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"We'll get you a guy, like that hot dancer Madonna used to have, Lourdes."
2610,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, no, no. That is not how I roll. Forget I said anything, all right?"
2611,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Because you agreed to this. I did not make you sign anything. I will not be intimidated by you.
2612,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Good morning, Mr. Donaghy."
2613,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Go to hell.
2614,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"No, thank you."
2615,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Kenneth, I'm sorry."
2616,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"How do you do it, Kenneth? How do you sit here every day, taking crap from people, and you keep smiling?"
2617,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"My mother always told me that even when things seem bad, there's someone else who's having a worse day."
2618,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,Like being stung by a bee or getting a splinter or being chained to a wall in someone's sex dungeon.
2619,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Isn't that a kick in the soft stuff, Kenneth?"
2620,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"You get strength from your mother, while mine is sucking the life out of me."
2621,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"She calls me constantly. That was her. That was her, complaining about where she's living, threatening to move in with me."
2622,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Ah, how wonderful."
2623,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"No, no, no. That's not wonderful."
2624,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"I run companies... plural. But to that woman, I'm always gonna be the punk kid who cried when Pop was run over by a mail truck."
2625,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Oh, my. A mailman killed your dad?"
2626,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"No, Pop was my dog. My dad left when I was 2, so I grew up calling my collie Pop."
2627,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,Oh. My mother is my best friend.
2628,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,My mother tried to send me to Vietnam to make a man out of me. I was 12.
2629,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Well, my mother has her dark times, too. But that's when I tell her, ""Mama, you carried me for nine months. Let me carry you now."""
2630,1,9,The Baby Show,jack,"You are a remarkable human being, Kenneth."
2631,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"I bought my mother a lovely retirement home... in Florida, with a tea garden and big rocks made of foam, because she falls down a lot."
2632,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Got everything she needs except a phone. I told those people... I made it clear... ""Do not give her a phone."""
2633,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,It's her. It's always her. Hello?
2634,1,9,The Baby Show,Dr. Spaceman,This is Dr. Leo Spaceman.
2635,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, hi. I'm sorry. I got this number under ""fertility"" in the Writers Guild health manual."
2636,1,9,The Baby Show,Dr. Spaceman,"I'm also listed under ""meth addiction"" and ""child psychiatry."""
2637,1,9,The Baby Show,Dr. Spaceman,So what can I help you with?
2638,1,9,The Baby Show,Dr. Spaceman,"I should start by saying that I can't personally help you conceive. Uh, something happened to me while scuba diving."
2639,1,9,The Baby Show,Frank,"Hey. So, Jenna told us you're looking for a baby daddy."
2640,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,She what?
2641,1,9,The Baby Show,Frank,Yeah. So?
2642,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,So...
2643,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Are you kidding me?!
2644,1,9,The Baby Show,Toofer,"Now, before you say no, I just want to say, our child would have a leg up getting into Harvard."
2645,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, really? Did you go to Harvard? 'Cause you haven't mentioned it in like three hours."
2646,1,9,The Baby Show,Frank,"Our kid would have strong, flat feet."
2647,1,9,The Baby Show,Lutz,"And if you choose me, I agree not to take my shirt off. But I do like to get yelled at during sex."
2648,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,You're disgusting.
2649,1,9,The Baby Show,Lutz,Yeah. That's a good start.
2650,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Get out of here. Jenna had no business telling you guys that.
2651,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,"Oh, hey. Blue pages. What? What's wrong?"
2652,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,Jenna told the writers that I am looking for a guy to get me pregnant. Can you believe her?
2653,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,I know. It's so uncool.
2654,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,"I mean, why would she go to them? Who do you know better than me?"
2655,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Aw, come on. Didn't you have a vasectomy?"
2656,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,"No, I just told my wife I did."
2657,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,And she doesn't get pregnant how?
2658,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,I fake it.
2659,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Is Jenna out here? Is she rehearsing?
2660,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,She's onstage.
2661,1,9,The Baby Show,Greta,"Excuse me, Ms. Lemon. Uh, I'm not usually this formal nor this bold, but I figure time is on neither one of our sides."
2662,1,9,The Baby Show,Greta,"Uh, could you excuse us for a second?"
2663,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,I'd kind of like him to stay.
2664,1,9,The Baby Show,Greta,Very well.
2665,1,9,The Baby Show,,"Ms. Lemon... Liz... I'd like to carry your child, if I might."
2666,1,9,The Baby Show,Greta,"I have a small ferret farm about 60 miles north of the city. It's not much, but it is self-sufficient."
2667,1,9,The Baby Show,Greta,"I can get cable if you want, 'cause I know how much you like the TV. Sometimes I watch you watching it."
2668,1,9,The Baby Show,Greta,Think about it.
2669,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Jenna? Stop telling everyone I need someone to get me pregnant.
2670,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,I'm not telling everyone.
2671,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Oh!
2672,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Guys, check this out. Oprah and Stedman are the same person."
2673,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,You know what? I don't have time for this conversation. I don't have time for anything.
2674,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,That's why he/she won't run for president. Mm-hmm.
2675,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Hey, you got to stop doing that impression. Tracy hates it."
2676,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,What? But it's funny. These guys like it.
2677,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,The Mars probe didn't break. It was attacked by a Martian cougar.
2678,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"This is how you take care of things, Liz Lemon? I'm going to Jack Donaghy."
2679,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"No. No, Tray. Please don't do that."
2680,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,Too late. This is untoward. This is not toward!
2681,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"You better fix this, nerd."
2682,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Otherwise Jack Donaghy is gonna kill me, then he's gonna kill you, and then he's gonna fold us up in a pizza and eat us."
2683,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,What?
2684,1,9,The Baby Show,Bobby,"Hey, Liz, I heard you're looking for a hookup."
2685,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, you know what? Everybody stop working right now!"
2686,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"I don't want to have sex with any of you. I have plenty of time to have a baby, and I am not looking for sperm donors."
2687,1,9,The Baby Show,Bobby,Okay. But do you still want a sound hookup so you can listen to rehearsal?
2688,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Yeah. Thanks.
2689,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"How are you, Bobby? Good? Great."
2690,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,Yo.
2691,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Tracy, it's Jack Donaghy. I hear we have a problem with Josh Girard."
2692,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Damn right! Keeps impersonating me, making me into a caricature."
2693,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"I would take care of this if I could, but it's tricky."
2694,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"You see, Josh's father is an assassin with the Russian mafia. They call him El Matador."
2695,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,Whoa. Those dudes are crazy. Forget it. I don't need any of that noise.
2696,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"It happies me to hear you say that. For being so understanding, I'm sending you our new super-top-secret invisible motorcycle."
2697,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,For real?
2698,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,For realsies.
2699,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to see a doctor. I keep pooping during sex."
2700,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Lemon, we have a problem."
2701,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,I have this whole Tracy-Josh thing under control.
2702,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,What are you talking about?
2703,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Nothing. What are you talking about?
2704,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"You. You yelling at the crew, you trawling for seed."
2705,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, it's a big misunderstanding. Jenna thinks that I want to have a baby."
2706,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,I should have known this was going to be a problem when I decided to mentor a woman.
2707,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"No, in fact, what I said was that my body is trying to make me think I want to have a baby."
2708,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,But my body is not the boss of me. My brain is.
2709,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"If you insist upon going all Murphy Brown on me, let me give you a tip."
2710,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Don't smother your child with affection to compensate for not having a man in your life.
2711,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Don't say, ""You're the only man I'll ever love."" Even babies know that's creepy."
2712,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Of course.
2713,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Don't put little notes in their lunch bag that say, ""Mommy's watching you."" People find those things."
2714,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"I bet you behaved yourself, though."
2715,1,9,The Baby Show,jack,"If your child is a terrific hockey player and a gifted flautist, don't make them play the national anthem on the flute in front of their teammates."
2716,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Your mother did that?
2717,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Now she wants to move in with me. I can't have that, Lemon."
2718,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Then be an adult and call her and say you love her very much but that living together is not going to work for you.
2719,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Oh, no. You don't know my mother."
2720,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,This is a woman that actually had a heart attack to prevent me from going on my honeymoon.
2721,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Maybe her heart broke 'cause she spent 20 years raising you and you're a total ingrate.
2722,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,That's exactly what she said.
2723,1,9,The Baby Show,,"Is this what you want, Lemon? To breathe life into another human being just to spend the rest of your days slowly sucking it out of them?"
2724,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,No. That's why my brain is the boss.
2725,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Speak of the devil.
2726,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Take a breath. Be nice.
2727,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Hello, Mother. So nice to hear your voice."
2728,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"No, I am not on anything."
2729,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"I know that things have been difficult for you lately, and I was thinking... you carried me for nine months. Let me carry you now."
2730,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Well, right back at you, Colleen! Yeah, that's right!"
2731,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,You cut Pop's balls off and left him in the street to die!
2732,1,9,The Baby Show,Cerie,"Liz, check out my wedding dress."
2733,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Absolutely not, young lady."
2734,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Kenneth, get Donaghy on the phone."
2735,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Jonathan, I have Tracy Jordan for Mr. Donaghy."
2736,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"No, no, no. Tracy, please, do not bother Jack."
2737,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,B. B. Jackson's condo?
2738,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,No.
2739,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,A children's clothing store in Dubai?
2740,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Stop guessing.
2741,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,What I'm saying is leave Jack alone.
2742,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Too late, Liz Lemon. He called me five minutes ago."
2743,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Five minutes ago, I was with him."
2744,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,How did he sound? What did he say?
2745,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Nothing unusual... Russian mobs, invisible motorcycles, sex pooping."
2746,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Are you insane?
2747,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,What are you gonna do when Tracy asks Jack for his invisible motorcycle?
2748,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Uh...
2749,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Yeah, dummy. Here's what you're gonna do."
2750,1,9,The Baby Show,Jonathan,It's not your mother!
2751,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Hello?
2752,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Donaghy!
2753,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"What's up, Tray?"
2754,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"If, in the future... "
2755,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"If, in the future...if I mention anything crazy... like an invisible motorcycle... it means I'm off my meds... and should be ignored."
2756,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Also, I think Josh Girard is a young Alec Guinness."
2757,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Go back on your meds, Tracy."
2758,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Hang up. 
2759,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Hang up.
2760,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,What? 
2761,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,What?
2762,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Idiot. 
2763,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Idiot.
2764,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Tracy, I've got to go."
2765,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Idiot.
2766,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,I think that went well.
2767,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Now you got to call Tracy as Jack.
2768,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Or I could call him as Christopher Walken.
2769,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Do you not understand what we're doing?
2770,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Jenna, did you tell Life & Style that your favorite book is the Koran?"
2771,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,I just wanted to sound smart.
2772,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, hi, baby."
2773,1,9,The Baby Show,Anna,Would you take her for a second? I'm trying to finish her eyes.
2774,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, I'm actually really busy."
2775,1,9,The Baby Show,Anna,Please. I heard you were baby-crazy.
2776,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Uh, no."
2777,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,"Yes, she is"
2778,1,9,The Baby Show,Anna,Please.
2779,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh. Oh, for the love of Nut. Okay."
2780,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"How about that, huh?"
2781,1,9,The Baby Show,Anna,"Yeah. She likes you. Go ahead, walk around."
2782,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Oh, okay."
2783,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,Look how pretty I look.
2784,1,9,The Baby Show,,You're the cutest baby in the world. Who's the cutest baby in the world? Who's the cutest baby in the world?
2785,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,How did I get home?
2786,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Why didn't you say something?
2787,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,Jack Donaghy?
2788,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"Now, I know you asked me not to say anything. But I think I know somebody that can help you with your sex-poop problem."
2789,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Hi.
2790,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Please don't hurt me.
2791,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,I can't help it. It just pours out of me.
2792,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,I'm Jack Donaghy. I'm important. I just bought the moon.
2793,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Oh, my God. I'm doing it again."
2794,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,What?
2795,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Mother, I love you, too. But living together is not gonna work out for me."
2796,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,"Yes, I went this morning."
2797,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,I don't know. Regular consistency.
2798,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,I can't do this.
2799,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Every day for the rest of your or her life. And she will outlive you. She's like Castro.
2800,1,9,The Baby Show,Tracy,"And when you're done with that, call my wife and tell her I'm sorry about what happened with me and Keith and them."
2801,1,9,The Baby Show,Josh,Wait. Who?
2802,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,"Oh, God! It's true that you had the baby."
2803,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,I don't know what happened.
2804,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"One minute, I was holding the baby in makeup. And then, suddenly, it was like highway hypnosis."
2805,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"You know, when you pull into your driveway, but you don't remember driving home?"
2806,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,"Oh, right, and you have someone else's baby in your car."
2807,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,I feel so terrible.
2808,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,Give me the baby. I'll try to smooth things over. What's her name?
2809,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Well, Anna calls her Isabelle, but I call her Nancy."
2810,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,Think it might be a good idea if I give Anna the rest of the week off.
2811,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,Seriously? We're really busy.
2812,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Well, of course, of course."
2813,1,9,The Baby Show,Jenna,Stealing a baby? Really?
2814,1,9,The Baby Show,Pete,"Hey, I found Isabelle! I'm a hero."
2815,1,9,The Baby Show,Anna,"Hi, baby. Oh, baby."
2816,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"You're loving this, aren't you?"
2817,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,"Oh, yes. I'm a big fan of kidnapping, especially by my middle management."
2818,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,The thing you were saying about listening to your mind and not your body... how's that going for you?
2819,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,My body is telling me several things.
2820,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"First of all, I need to start working out. That kid was killing my arms."
2821,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Number two, I could be very happy with a baby that looks nothing like me and didn't bake in my oven."
2822,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Three, I got to let myself have a personal life."
2823,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,That's what I've been telling you for five months.
2824,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Well, you're right again."
2825,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Write it down in your little ""I'm Awesome"" book."
2826,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Where are you going? You have a rehearsal about to start.
2827,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"I stole a baby, Jack. I'm taking a half day."
2828,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,Fair enough.
2829,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,I have to do some thinking.
2830,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Maybe it's impossible to have it all... the career, the family."
2831,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"But if anybody can figure out how to do it, it's me."
2832,1,9,The Baby Show,Jack,That's going up.
2833,1,9,The Baby Show,Liz,"Aw, nerds!"
2834,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"I was talking about you at work today, Mother."
2835,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"I think my boss, Mr. Jack Donaghy, wishes you were his mother."
2836,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Isn't that something, Mother?"
2837,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth's Mother,"Yes, Kenneth. That's sweet."
2838,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth's Mother,Do you have me on speakerphone again?
2839,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Yes, ma'am. It's just like ""Charlie's Angels."""
2840,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth's Mother,"Oh, by the way, did you get your old Halloween decorations I sent you?"
2841,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Oh, yes! Thank you."
2842,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,I'm looking at the kooky skeleton right now. I love it.
2843,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,You're the best mother in the whole world.
2844,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth's Mother,"Okay. Calm down, dear."
2845,1,9,The Baby Show,Kenneth,"Yes, Mother."
2846,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"The flowers are lovely, thank you."
2847,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"No, you hang up first."
2848,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Okay, on the count of three. One, two, three. No, I didn't hang up, either."
2849,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Donaghy, I need your help!"
2850,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"I miss you, too. I said, ""I miss you, too."" You're breaking up. Maureen? She cut out."
2851,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"I need $60,000, or I'm gonna lose my house."
2852,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Which house?
2853,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"I need $100,000, or I'm gonna lose both my houses."
2854,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Tracy, I don't understand. You've starred in 14 films. You don't have any money saved?"
2855,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,No. I lost all of it.
2856,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Really? Who's your money manager?
2857,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Grizz.
2858,1,10,The Rural Juror,Grizz,"WorldCom, man. WorldCom."
2859,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Look, Tracy, I can't just give you money. But what I can do is show you how you can earn all the money you need."
2860,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,You must know Arsenio.
2861,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Hall or Billingham?
2862,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,You know someone named Arsenio Billingham?
2863,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,No.
2864,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"A few years ago, Arsenio Hall came to a colleague of mine with a similar problem."
2865,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,My friend suggested that we brand Arsenio... put his name and face on a product.
2866,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Because of Arsenio's ""woof woof"" catchphrase, we settled on dog food."
2867,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,The product was a runaway success.
2868,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,The company and Arsenio made millions.
2869,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,I like that. Put my name on something.
2870,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,But what would I sell?
2871,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,The product is irrelevant. The people aren't buying that. They're buying you.
2872,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Now, you come back with an idea of a product you'd be willing to sell... anything at all... and you'll have all the money you can dream of."
2873,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,I'm on it.
2874,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,I forgot about that WorldCom mess.
2875,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Why you got to be so obsessed with telecommunications?
2876,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Get me Maureen Dowd back on the phone, please."
2877,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Hey, I got to miss an hour of rehearsal today 'cause I just found out from my publicist I've been booked on ""The View."""
2878,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"Oh, Jenna, that's great."
2879,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"For the first time in your life, you'll be in a room full of women, and you'll be the least crazy one."
2880,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,I know.
2881,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, you know what clip you should show? ""MTV Darfur."" You and Tracy were really funny in that."
2882,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, this isn't for ""TGS."" It's for my movie. ""The 'Rura Jura""' has a limited release next week."
2883,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, congratulations."
2884,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"I didn't know they had a release date for ""The Rur..."" for that movie."
2885,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, sorry. Got to take this. Hello?"
2886,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,You still don't know what the title is?
2887,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,No. No one does.
2888,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,It's gone on way too long to ask her about it.
2889,1,10,The Rural Juror,Writer 1,"This title isn't hard to understand, right?"
2890,1,10,The Rural Juror,Writer 2,No. It's awesome.
2891,1,10,The Rural Juror,Writer 1,I love that we can work while we're on coca1ne.
2892,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Could it be ""Roar Her, Gem Her""?"
2893,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"No. That doesn't make any sense. It's got to be ""Oral Germ Whore."""
2894,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Okay. Bye. Sorry. That was my publicist.
2895,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"You know, I have to admit, I kind of like that Tracy Jordan is no longer the only movie star on ""TGS."""
2896,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Maybe I'll finally start getting some respect around here.
2897,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"What's up, flabby butt? You look weird today."
2898,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"Hey, Pete, you want to see a comic book with pregnant zombie nuns?"
2899,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"Yes, I do."
2900,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,Cool.
2901,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,And I have a screener of the movie for you. I want you to watch it.
2902,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Ah. ""The Rural Juror."" That is something."
2903,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,I can't wait to watch it.
2904,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, you won't be disappointed."
2905,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,The source material was amazing. It's hard to go wrong with a Kevin Grisham novel.
2906,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,You mean John Grisham?
2907,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, no. Kevin. John's brother."
2908,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Did you know that before Kevin was a novelist, he worked at a recycling center?"
2909,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Wow.
2910,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"And he just finished writing the sequel. It's called ""Urban Fervor."""
2911,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Boy, these titles. They really make you think."
2912,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, wow."
2913,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Oh!
2914,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Doesn't it seem like just yesterday we were doing the show back in Chicago, dreaming about being in the movies?"
2915,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,We've come a long way from that apartment we shared in Little Armenia.
2916,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, it was so weird there."
2917,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Do you remember that neighborhood festival where they killed a goat in the street?
2918,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Yes! But we did have really good luck that year.
2919,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Yeah.
2920,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,I need to come up with a big idea for a product to put my name on.
2921,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Something no one has thought of. Something crazy.
2922,1,10,The Rural Juror,Kenneth,I know a gentleman who had a lot of crazy ideas.
2923,1,10,The Rural Juror,Kenneth,He was a carpenter. He wanted everyone to love one another.
2924,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Oh, you mean Jesus?"
2925,1,10,The Rural Juror,Kenneth,No. Miguel from set design. He's over there.
2926,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Eureko!
2927,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"Hey, what are you doing back here? They're rehearsing your Paris Hilton sketch."
2928,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,I'm trying to avoid Jenna. She gave me a screener of her movie.
2929,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,And?
2930,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, Pete, it's awful. I couldn't believe how bad it was."
2931,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Although I guess it's no surprise that Tony Hawk can't play blind.
2932,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,So you must know the title.
2933,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Yes! Yes. ""The Rural Juror."""
2934,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"""The Ru..."""
2935,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Rural.
2936,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"""The R..."""
2937,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Rural.
2938,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,Eh. So what are you gonna do about Jenna?
2939,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Same I've always done when she's in something terrible... think of one thing nice to say and then hug her.
2940,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"So, what did you think?"
2941,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, my God. You looked so beautiful."
2942,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,The lighting was really neat.
2943,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Ethan and I both thought the programs were really easy to read.
2944,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"So, what nice thing are you gonna say about ""The Roaring Junior""?"
2945,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, I don't know. It's a mess."
2946,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"No, you've got to tell them that when Paris Hilton tries to make out with the bear, the bear has to act like he's into it."
2947,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,Right.
2948,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Donaghy, stop what you're doing, 'cause I'm about to blow your mind."
2949,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Hit it!
2950,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Tired of your sandwich making you angry? Then behold... the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine!
2951,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Stick any three meats, whatever you want... bologna, salami, boar... whatever... into this sexy lady, and she will melt them all together into one delicious food ball."
2952,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Never again will you have to suffer through the bread part of your sandwich.
2953,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,I give you the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine.
2954,1,10,The Rural Juror,All,Meat is the new bread. Rrrah!
2955,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,What do you think?
2956,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Well, it's certainly not the worst celebrity-product idea I've ever heard."
2957,1,10,The Rural Juror,Whoopi,Hi. I'm Whoopi Goldberg. And you're working out with Whoopi.
2958,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"With Tracy Jordan behind this, it just might work."
2959,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"We'll roll it out in time for Christmas, manufacture it for 4 bucks, slap your name on it, nd sell it for $50."
2960,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,So G. E. will produce the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine?
2961,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Oh, no, no."
2962,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"G. E. could never make something so, um... unique."
2963,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,We'll have to pass this off to one of our subsidiaries.
2964,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"You see, G. E. owns KitchenAll of Colorado, which in turn owns JMI of Stanford, which is a majority shareholder in pokerfastlane. com, which recently acquired the Sheinhardt Wig Company, which owns NBC outright."
2965,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"NBC owns Winnipeg Iron Works, which owns the Ahp Chanagi Party Meats Corporation of Pyongyang, North Korea. And they will make the Meat Machine."
2966,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Jack Donaghy, you are the best."
2967,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,You know what? I'm gonna make you a mix tape.
2968,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,You like Phil Collins?
2969,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"I've got two ears and a heart, don't I?"
2970,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,All right. Jenna's on next.
2971,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Everyone shut up so we can hear the title of this stupid movie.
2972,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbra Walters,"And coming up, I'll be talking to ""The Girlie Show"" star Jenna Maroney about her upcoming project, ""The 'Ruro Jurr.""'"
2973,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,That is not helpful.
2974,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,"Hey, do you know the name of Jenna's movie yet?"
2975,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, yeah. She gave me a screener."
2976,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,Okay.
2977,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"No, no, no. I'm not telling you anything about it. I'm not giving you more ammunition to make fun of her with."
2978,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,So it's bad.
2979,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,How bad? Please! Just give us one detail.
2980,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Okay, fine."
2981,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Jenna plays a Southern lawyer named Constance Justice.
2982,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,You got to let us see this.
2983,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,No.
2984,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"Come on, Liz!"
2985,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,No!
2986,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"Aw, man. Constance Justice."
2987,1,10,The Rural Juror,Writer,Justice has been served.
2988,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,Good stuff. Yeah.
2989,1,10,The Rural Juror,PA,"Tracy to the stage, please, for ""Pull Your Own Wisdom Teeth. """
2990,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, excuse me. Hey. There you are."
2991,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"So, what did you think of the movie?"
2992,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, my God, Jenna. The soundtrack was so moody."
2993,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,What else did you like about it?
2994,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"What? Oh. Um, you were good. Your face was very expressive."
2995,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,And another cool part was... the trees.
2996,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,I got to get back to work.
2997,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,You didn't like the movie.
2998,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,What? Yes. I just said I liked the movie.
2999,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Uh, no, you didn't."
3000,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,You did that condescending compliment thing you always do.
3001,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,What? When have I ever done that?
3002,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"So, what did you think?"
3003,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, my God. You looked beautiful."
3004,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,The lighting was really neat.
3005,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Ethan and I both thought the programs were really easy to read.
3006,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Well, that's not how I remember any of that."
3007,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Look, Liz, for once, be honest with me. I want your real opinion."
3008,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Okay.
3009,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"I thought the story was preposterous, I thought the acting was way over the top, and I thought it was about an hour too long."
3010,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,It's only 90 minutes.
3011,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,It's kind of a train wreck.
3012,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,A train wreck? Okay.
3013,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,I'm not trying to be a jerk here. You asked me for my opinion.
3014,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Yeah. No. No. I understand. Thank you.
3015,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"I wasn't kidding about how cool those trees were, though. What were they, oaks?"
3016,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,Damn it. Where are my car keys?
3017,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,"Jack, Tracy. what can I do for you?"
3018,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Leo, We have a product we want you to give a medical endorsement to."
3019,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,I'll do it. What is it?
3020,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,It's called the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine. It's a dual-press grill.
3021,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,"Say no more. If it's giving people meat, then I'm on board."
3022,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,I've always said humans need more animal blood. It keeps the spine straight.
3023,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"We appreciate it, Leo."
3024,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,"You boys need anything while you're here... some reds, yellows? Just got some purples in from Peru."
3025,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"No, I'm good."
3026,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Well, it would be rude not to take one or two."
3027,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbra Walters,"All right. Now, ""The Rural Juror"" is the true story of Roy Jerner, whose pure furor ensures a terrible m*rder."
3028,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbra Walters,Excuse me. Meg.
3029,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,I feel like I'm getting further away from it.
3030,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,Hey. Last night I broke into Liz's office. I got Jenna's movie.
3031,1,10,The Rural Juror,Toofer,How'd you get in there?
3032,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,That weird security guard Tony let me in.
3033,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,I also looked on Liz's computer.
3034,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,"Her last two Google searches were for ""singles yoga"" and ""scalp pain."""
3035,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,That is grim.
3036,1,10,The Rural Juror,Toofer,"""The Rural Juror""?"
3037,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,"Man, that's disappointing. I had to let Tony watch me pee to get that tape."
3038,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,What?
3039,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Hey, you wanted to see me."
3040,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Yeah. I don't want to wear this Paris Hilton nose.
3041,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,I'm sorry. You have to wear the nose. There's a whole bunch of jokes in the sketch about the nose.
3042,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Well, to be perfectly honest, I think the entire sketch is a train wreck."
3043,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, I see. We're not talking about the nose. We're talking about the movie."
3044,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"You're wrong about it, Liz."
3045,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,It's getting some very positive early reviews. Teenmoviescene.com gave it five out of five iPods.
3046,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Jenna, believe what you want. I'm your friend. I'm telling you the truth."
3047,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Please. Here's what's really going on.
3048,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,It's killing you that I'm in something good that you had nothing to do with. And now you're taking it out on me.
3049,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, come on."
3050,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Well, enjoy kicking me around for now, Liz, because I won't be on your crappy little show forever."
3051,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Really?
3052,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Really.
3053,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Really?
3054,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Really.
3055,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Really?
3056,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Really.
3057,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Well, Jenna, I'm sorry you feel that way."
3058,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dinosaur,Aah! What the hell?
3059,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, God. I'm sorry. I didn't know there was a person in there."
3060,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Pete, could you tell Liz Lemon not to stand in my eye line while I'm rehearsing, please?"
3061,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Pete, could you tell Jenna she smells like a stripper?"
3062,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"So, uh, are you guys still fighting?"
3063,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,We've reached kind of an understanding.
3064,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"She's not talking to me, and to retaliate, I'm writing impressions for her that she can't do."
3065,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
3066,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,You guys can't go on like this. You have to apologize to her.
3067,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"I didn't do anything wrong. She insisted on me telling her what I thought of her crappy movie, and then she attacked me."
3068,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,"Liz, I can't have the head writer and one of the stars of the show fighting."
3069,1,10,The Rural Juror,Pete,I can barely keep a lid on the feud between Kenneth and Dougie from props.
3070,1,10,The Rural Juror,Kenneth,Stop it.
3071,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Audience, let me ask you a question. How many times has this happened to you?"
3072,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Or this?
3073,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Seem familiar?
3074,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Bread is one of the worst things in the world, but we've always needed it... until now."
3075,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"By burning three different types of meat together, the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine takes bread out of the equation."
3076,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff.
3077,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,That's delicious.
3078,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,And it's healthy.
3079,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,Hi. I'm Dr. Leo Spaceman.
3080,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,I'm a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Minh City School of Medicine.
3081,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Dr. Spaceman, is it true that bread eats away at your brain?"
3082,1,10,The Rural Juror,Dr. Spaceman,We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research.
3083,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Well, folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again."
3084,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine... say it with me, now..."
3085,1,10,The Rural Juror,All,Meat is the new bread!
3086,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Where did you guys get this tape?
3087,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"Uh, Josh broke into your office."
3088,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,You went in my office without permission?
3089,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,Because I'm worried about your scalp pain.
3090,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Hello, everyone. Frank, could you tell Liz..."
3091,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,No. Not interested.
3092,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Girl writer, could you tell Liz that I..."
3093,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Jenna, stop this. It's stupid."
3094,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Let's just go in my office and talk.
3095,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, there is nothing to talk about."
3096,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Stop making this something it isn't. I just didn't like the movie because it's bad.
3097,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,These guys watched it. They'll tell you.
3098,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,"Actually, we all kind of liked it."
3099,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"What? No, you didn't."
3100,1,10,The Rural Juror,Toofer,Yeah. We all did.
3101,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"It's not the best thing in the world, but it's solid, and Jenna's really good in it."
3102,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Thank you, Frank."
3103,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Look. Look at her. She can't stand that I'm in something good.
3104,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,It's probably because of her own intellectual insecurities.
3105,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"What? Frank, shut up."
3106,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,Fine. Dismiss me.
3107,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"I guess because I look weird, I can't be perceptive."
3108,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,I can't believe you liked this movie.
3109,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Ugh!
3110,1,10,The Rural Juror,Josh,Jeez. I hope those two work it out.
3111,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"Relax, man."
3112,1,10,The Rural Juror,Frank,"As long as they're yapping at each other, we're not working. Enjoy it."
3113,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,I want these everywhere.
3114,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,I want every person here eating from a Tracy Jordan Meat Machine.
3115,1,10,The Rural Juror,Kenneth,"Ow! Ah, cheese and crackers, that smarts!"
3116,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,What happened?
3117,1,10,The Rural Juror,Kenneth,"The grease burned me, Mr. Jordan. The machine must be broken."
3118,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,That one must be defective.
3119,1,10,The Rural Juror,Kenneth,Ah! Ow! My face! My page jacket!
3120,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,They all must be like that. Where's Donaghy?
3121,1,10,The Rural Juror,Kenneth,Ah. Can somebody take me to a hospital?
3122,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Jenna, stop. I just want to get past this. What do you need me to do?"
3123,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Well, you can start by saying you're sorry."
3124,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Fine. I am sorry that I assumed other people would hate the movie just because I hate it. That was wrong.
3125,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,That's it? That's your apology?
3126,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Yeah. Are we good?
3127,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,We're good.
3128,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Great.
3129,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Do I have to wear the nose tonight?
3130,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Yes, you do."
3131,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Okay. Well, then I hope you get bird flu and die."
3132,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,What did you just say to me?
3133,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"You are a big fake, you know that, Liz?"
3134,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,She doesn't even need those glasses.
3135,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Really? I'm a fake, blondie? I'm a fake?"
3136,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Burning jets of grease, huh? Were any of our people hurt?"
3137,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Only Kenneth.
3138,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Good.
3139,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,What are we gonna do? We can't sell this.
3140,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,You're right. We can't sell this... in the United States.
3141,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,What?
3142,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,We simply have to find a market with lax safety regulations.
3143,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"With your international appeal, we can go anywhere."
3144,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,How about the Ukraine?
3145,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Not the Ukraine, I own some property on the Dnieper River."
3146,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,In Volyn?
3147,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,Closer to Cherkassy.
3148,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"We'll find another country, then. How do you feel about Venezuela?"
3149,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,"Can't do it, Donaghy. I can't put my name on a product that's gonna hurt people."
3150,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"That's disappointing, although I admire your integrity."
3151,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jonathan,"Mr. Donaghy, they need you onstage immediately... some kind of emergency."
3152,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Crying out loud.
3153,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,I'm sorry that we're not all weeping with gratitude at getting to read your words.
3154,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,I am so glad I studied voice at Northwestern so I could do raps about Suri Cruise.
3155,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, please. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be slutting it up for car-dealership owners so they'd put you in their commercials."
3156,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,So now I'm a slut?
3157,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Yeah.
3158,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Let me tell you something. This slut slept with your brother.
3159,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Mitch?!
3160,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Yeah, and let me tell you something about Mitch. He is disgusting in bed."
3161,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,You know he's not right. He was in a really bad skiing accident!
3162,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Ladies.
3163,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Sit down.
3164,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Now, what is this about?"
3165,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"It's about my movie, ""The Rural Juror."""
3166,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"They've adapted ""The Rural Juror""? I'm a huge Kevin Grisham fan."
3167,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Jenna has taken the fact that I don't like her movie and blown it completely out of proportion. She twisted my boob.
3168,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Liz, you wanted the movie to be bad. You wanted me to fail."
3169,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Let me tell you something. Liz has always supported you.
3170,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"When I wanted you out of here, she wouldn't give in."
3171,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,I've never seen her so worked up.
3172,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,She came at me with that angry little badger face... There it is right now.
3173,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"The point is, she went to the mat for you, and she was right."
3174,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"I know, but..."
3175,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,But nothing. Now you're accusing Liz of undermining you?
3176,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,They did warn me those diet pills were mood-altering.
3177,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,Yeah. I think you owe her an apology.
3178,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh... Liz, I'm sorry."
3179,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,No. Don't be.
3180,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,You're right. I did want the movie to be bad.
3181,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Wow.
3182,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"The one time I try to take your side, Lemon, you sandbag me."
3183,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"I'm sorry, Jenna."
3184,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"I smelled crazy in here, and I assumed it was you."
3185,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, God, Liz. I mean, I wish you had written my movie, too."
3186,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,It's not that. It's just...
3187,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,The dream that we had in Chicago of getting famous...
3188,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"We had it. It was my dream, too, Jenna."
3189,1,10,The Rural Juror,,Yeah. But you couldn't have been serious about acting for a living. You have brown hair.
3190,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Look, I like what I do now. But there's still this sad little part of me that wants to be the center of attention. That wants to get my hair done and get free clothes. That wants to be you, I guess."
3191,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,Your movie just brought all that stuff up again.
3192,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,This is boring. I'm bored now.
3193,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Oh, God, Liz. I had no idea."
3194,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a jackass."
3195,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,No. I'm sorry.
3196,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,So you really think I'm beautiful?
3197,1,10,The Rural Juror,Liz,I never said that.
3198,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Oh, I'm sorry."
3199,1,10,The Rural Juror,Whoopi,"Feed me, Whoopi."
3200,1,10,The Rural Juror,All,Whoopi!
3201,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracy,What's this?
3202,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,I gave the Meat Machine to Whoopi.
3203,1,10,The Rural Juror,Tracu,Goldberg or Billingham?
3204,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,Looks like Whoopi's made herself another billion hryvna.
3205,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jack,"Uh, food ball?"
3206,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbara Walters,Let's get personal.
3207,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbera Walters,"Your father, Werner, was a burger server in suburban Santa Barbara..."
3208,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"Yes, that's right."
3209,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbera Walters,"...when he spurned your mother, Verna, for a curly-haired surfer named Roberta. Did that hurt her?"
3210,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,"It was hard on all of us, yes."
3211,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbera Walters,Hmm. Fleg meg gleg fleg meg meg. Meg tennis meg meg was a meg meg fleg?
3212,1,10,The Rural Juror,Jenna,I'll always be his little girl.
3213,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbera Walters,Gleg.
3214,1,10,The Rural Juror,Barbera Walters,Gleg.
