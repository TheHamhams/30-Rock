{"name": "Jack", "line": "Yeah."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "Frank, Six Sigma is the elite G. E. Executive Training Course. To master just its basic concepts, one must brave a five-day conference at a Sheraton. Six Sigma says that a manager must understand, every aspect of the business he or she oversees."},

{"name": "Cerie", "line": "You guys want coffee?"},
{"name": "Frank", "line": "Oh, yeah."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "So, I was doing some research on comedy, and I came across the cartoon strip \"Dilbert.\", It's quite good. And I was wondering if we could do that."},

{"name": "Jack", "line": "\"Dilbert.\""},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "You guys want coffee?"},
{"name": "Frank", "line": "Oh, yeah."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "No, no, no, no, no. You can't say that. Jeb Bush is a friend of mine."},

{"name": "Jack", "line": "Sean Penn. No, Barbra Streisand."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "He guns it. Girl falls into the water."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "You guys want coffee?"},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "So he circled back, looking for her. Remember, it's pitch-black out. The boat hits something... hard... and you hear kind of, \"eeeeughh.\", And Brokaw says, \"Just go. Don't look back.\", Now, I'm not a writer, but maybe there's a skit in that."},

{"name": "Liz", "line": "What do you all not understand? He's our boss."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Me trying to tell Jack what to do, would be like you trying to boss around... which one of your kids is it that you're afraid of?"},
{"name": "Pete", "line": "Kyle. Kyle. So strong."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Oh, come on. That was a jacket. That's it. I got to talk to her about her clothes. She can't dress like that."},
{"name": "Pete", "line": "Yes, she can. People like the way she dresses."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Oh, come on. It's distracting. It's inappropriate."},

{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Sure."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Okay. This is gonna sound really weird, but, um... you need to wear a bra."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Oh, no, I... I don't, actually. They kind of just stay up on their own. See?"},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Yeah, okay. What I'm saying is, you need to wear a bra to work, if you want to be taken seriously in this business."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Oh, but I don't actually want to work in television."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Career-wise, I'm just gonna marry rich, and then design handbags."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Here's the thing. The way that you dress, is making some people around the office uncomfortable."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Really? Who?"},
{"name": "Pete", "line": "Not me."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "I guess it's mostly me that has the problem with it."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Oh, because you have, like, one of those body-image things?"},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "No, it's not that."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Good, because I was gonna say, you still have a good body."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Well, thank you, but this isn't about me."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Like, how'd you dress before you were married?"},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "I'm not married, Cerie."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Oh, for some reason I thought you had, like, three kids."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Nope. Never married. No kids."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "'Cause sometimes you have, like, food stains on your shirt and stuff. I just assumed that it was kids."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "You know what? Forget I mentioned it. You look great."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Is it my birthday?"},
{"name": "Toofer", "line": "You have to get Donaghy out of the room."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Boy, we, as a group, might not smell great."},
{"name": "Frank", "line": "Come on, he's stifling us. I feel like I just can't be myself around him."},
{"name": "Lutz", "line": "Yeah, Tracy's downstairs right now, rehearsing the best thing we've written all week."},
{"name": "Tracy", "line": "Beep, beep, ribby, ribby."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "All right."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "All right, I'll take care of it."},
{"name": "Frank", "line": "Thanks, Liz."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Hey, Mr. Donaghy."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "Sorry I'm late. I was at a luncheon for Ann Coulter's 60th birthday."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Oh, yeah. Listen, it's been really great having you in the room, these last few days..."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "Oh, it's been great for me, too, being around all this creativity."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "I'll tell you, in the beginning, I thought it was gonna be a bit of a chore, honestly, but now... oh, I have an idea for you. Uh, Monkey Senate. We open on the Capitol..."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "You can't be in here anymore!"},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "What's that?"},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "It's not working."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "You're driving everybody crazy, and, okay, you can just fire me now, and I will go back to teaching improv to senior citizens."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "Why would I want to fire you? This is fine. Six Sigma values direct and honest communication, between coworkers, so, uh... Thank you, Liz."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Oh, sure."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "I'll just head upstairs now."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Okay, well, thank you for being so understanding."},
{"name": "Jack", "line": "Absolutely."},
{"name": "Kenneth", "line": "Oh, no! I will not let you down, sir."},
{"name": "Kenneth", "line": "Go get help, girl."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Hey, Jonathan. I left a bunch of messages for Jack, but I haven't heard back. Do you know if he got them?"},
{"name": "Jonathan", "line": "Mr. Donaghy's been very busy."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Oh, well, I just... I really need him to approve this budget."},
{"name": "Jonathan", "line": "Well, I'm sorry. He's out of the country till the end of the week."},
{"name": "Tracy", "line": "You want to know another key to success?"},
{"name": "Kenneth", "line": "I do, Mr. Jordan."},
{"name": "Tracy", "line": "Dress every day like you gonna get murdered in those clothes."},
{"name": "Tracy", "line": "You did real good the other day with those nachos, but I need you to do something of a different nature."},
{"name": "Tracy", "line": "Okay, would you agree when I say, that a man's freedom only exists, when he's free to pursue his desires?"},
{"name": "Kenneth", "line": "Yes, I suppose I would."},
{"name": "Tracy", "line": "Which means when the law conflicts with our desires, then we must operate outside the law."},
{"name": "Tracy", "line": "You following me?"},
{"name": "Kenneth", "line": "Otherwise, we would no longer be free."},
{"name": "Tracy", "line": "Now, I got a mission for you."},
{"name": "Cerie", "line": "Hey, Liz. I took your advice. I'm wearing a bra."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "That's great, Cerie."},
{"name": "Jonathan", "line": "Liz, can I speak to you for a second?"},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Sure. What's going on?"},
{"name": "Jonathan", "line": "Mr. Donaghy is very upset, that you banned him from the writers' room. He wants you to apologize."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "Really?!"},
{"name": "Jonathan", "line": "But when you apologize, you have to act like it was your idea. He can't know that I told you."},
{"name": "Liz", "line": "But he sent you here to tell me to apologize."},
{"name": "Jonathan", "line": "Exactly. I penciled you in for 3:00. This conversation never happened."},
{"name": "PA", "line": "Jenna, set yourself, please, for \"Who Wants to Eat a Dictionary?\""},

{"name": "", "line": "Y'all have long fingernails."},
{"name": "", "line": "Now, do y'all rent this space, or do you own it?"},
{"name": "", "line": "Hey! That's a funny-looking fish."},

{"name": "", "line": "Do you have a cellphone? What's your plan?"},
{"name": "", "line": "This apology thing is... interesting."},
{"name": "", "line": "Oh, even when it's something normal, I hate going up to Jack's office."},

{"name": "", "line": "I'm on a helicopter in 15 minutes."},
{"name": "", "line": "Uh... well, sir, I just wanted to say, um, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings the other day, when I asked you to stay out of the writers' room."},
